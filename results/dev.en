However , the father of the child , a senior citizen , does not comply with this decision .
The EU is exposing a building in the stabilisation process , and therefore the cessation of its enlargement would be contrary to the principle of which it is based .

For this reason , we also abstained from voting on the motions by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) on Facebook in Portugal , although it is known that the Portuguese Communist Party is critical of the situation in Portugal .
Thank you , colleagues , for the treatment of the last hour .
These amendments will have a significant impact on the lives of the European public because they will have immediate consequences for the buildings in which they live , and will create a need to develop more effective technologies in the construction sector .
I particularly welcome the proposed resolution , which was tabled during this part-session .
I am appalled .

The structure that can not be implemented is particularly bad law .
In my opinion , this is an extremely important institution which can strengthen and develop European disease monitoring systems , as well as assess and submitted information on the existing and emerging threats to human health caused by infectious diseases .

Four years is the introduction of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development .
The report moves in this direction , so I voted for it .
The separation of organs is without doubt one of the most nuanced aspects of the advancement of health , but at the same time , they are opening the way for a number of problems relating to the rights of donors and patients , which must be dealt with by an ethical , social , legal and economic perspective .
The oil consumed in the Mediterranean are not the same boats that invaded in the Atlantic and vice versa .
( PT ) Madam President , I would like to start by focusing on the importance of relations between the United States and the European Union , especially in the context of a global economic crisis .
It is not acceptable , nor sensible , to make every product caught in the European Union , based on an assessment of its client , and it is regrettable that - at least as I see it - this is included in the text as an opportunity for 2012 .

author . - Mr President , the fact that the human rights violations in China have once again been discussing the violations of human rights in China indicates that the Libyan leadership in Beijing remains determined to pile down any political disagreement .
For Poland and also for Warsaw , the key factor will be the level of funding and priorities set out in the Cohesion Fund .
I am pleased that , in this document , we have remained invoking , where we say , we strongly urge the Commission to submit bold and innovative proposals for a substantial review of the own-resources system .
One is the mobilisation of the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection and the other one - the revitalisation of the Solidarity Fund .

Heavy contamination of heavy vehicles ( vote )
The debate is closed .
There will then be sense from a wide-ranging aid programme - the most beautiful , not limited to one or two branches of the economy .
I , too , am pleased to be here with you , as each month .
( LT ) Madam President , firstly , I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue today , particularly with regard to the European Union countries .
However , taking into account the false political relevance of the solution , unfortunately , the speculative attack - and even increased - in the last 24 hours , surrounded by certain ambiguities around the support mechanism - which , President of the Council , should subsequently be clarified - and from the crowds of mixed origin and the objective of which different options , such as the one that has emerged in Greece a few days ago , is that there was a call for a renegotiation of the agreement this 25 March .
I am very proud of the fact that we have engaged in this Parliament - and I think excellent - with regard to the Human Rights Council in Geneva .
One thing is very clear to me - that from now on , we need to make decisions much more quickly .
( FI ) Mr President , it is quite surprising that some of my fellow Members consider it inappropriate to talk about one of the poorest countries in the world .
I am also witnesses of the colonialism of the Maltese shelves , as well as the old champagne of the shells that ravaged the horse years , where the unborn human shields are in dire straits .
I hope that this long-awaited Paper will guide the European Union in the right direction and lead to some specific political action .
This text does not , in fact , promote creativity .
Atypical activities are to a significant extent of debts or delays in payments , which often become the cause of the low-cost companies to go bankrupt because of the domino effect .
( PL ) I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information .
I think there is no reason to demonise these authorities .
I think that Romania offers a model of good practice for too many countries in the European Union .
It is not only a building new building in Luxembourg , which will lead to greater carbon emissions , which will contribute to climate change or not , depending on the point , but it is also inescapable to us to hold a debate on climate change until we continue to work at three different places .
This is an area in which Europe can put its own line by adding value to the management of one of globalisation 's oligopolistic dimensions , namely the lowest amount of migration and , consequently , migration flows and their impact on all relevant areas of European integration .

It is easy for us to speak , but it is very difficult for us to take effective action .
There is a question of subsidiarity to this debate .
The regulation makes clear the management of the facilities deployed in the waters of the GFCM zone , particularly in the Mediterranean .
I am particularly pleased with the improvements in the requirements to provide information in the sales of homes and distance contracts .
That is why , in view of the advantages that arise from the entry into force of this protocol , there is no reason why we do not accept it .
I support the position that the current economic constraints and the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon can help Member States to make bolder defence costs by aligning and sharing the greater part of their defensive capacity , budgets and requirements , right at the same time by the economic and financial crisis , comprised of the national defence budgets , programmes and public/private structures , and so more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , there are still no clear signs of the EU 's comprehensive approach after Lisbon , helping to overcome traditional procedural and institutional obstacles .
The issue of the growing repression of the opposition must be raised at the summit and opposition parties must be allowed to register .

Nevertheless , many countries have adopted these restrictive measures , countries with a different economic basis , such as the United States , China , Argentina , Russia and Indonesia , and also many developing countries .
In view of this , I voted in favour of this report because it will allow Member States if they are willing to charge tolls on the road network and for certain limited external costs in order to introduce the 'polluter pays ' principle in the area of road transport .
This deplorable behaviour fills the discovery that Iceland is at the top of the guise of the sustainable management of fisheries .

In this regard , Parliament and the Council have the same objectives and this naturally applies everywhere , in all areas and for all institutions .
The treaty , with its inertia of 'one method ' , implies absolute respect for the role of all the European institutions .
However , given this , and as I can not exclude EU citizens from using cooking or municipal timber and products , it is important that sectoral agreements be adopted .
Closure of the sitting
The main causes of the abandonment of children are poverty , inadequate social conservation systems , the lack of adequate social marine networks or adequate public services , as well as conflicts and military interventions .
( PT ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the Swedish Presidency , in particular Prime Minister Reinfeldt , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and on behalf of the Portuguese delegation in the PPE Group .
Mr President , the regulation that we are discussing today was ignored by all the committees for a long time .
Obviously , their words does not cost anything .
The proposed indicative of vaccination , which will be disclosed retroactively from the first day of late payment , presents a concrete method to prevent this practice .
However , we know very well that she will be going on anyway , and there is therefore a choice to go within the euro area , which will simply get the burning on the road and it will come back to us to attack us , and may go beyond the euro area , where it can not solve its problem .
The Presidency intends to invite the ministers to adopt the Council conclusions on the action plan at the Council meeting in March 2009 and a common approach or political agreement on the aforementioned proposal at the Council meeting in June 2009 .
The pretext set to date is EUR 33 000 .
You have just heard what the previous speaker said ; we often see that when it comes too far as quickly as possible , the opposite of what is intended .
I believe that the European funding proposed by the ENPI must prioritise measures aimed at cross-border cooperation in the area that the Eastern Partnership is aimed at .

They are afraid that patients will travel to countries where they will not have to wait for months or years for the operation , as is happening in my country .
In this context , I also find it important that the European Parliament should review one point of the Commission 's proposal in the resolution : like the Baltic Sea region , there is already an important international agreement on counter-terrorism issues ; this agreement represents consensus and led to a common statement allowing the conservation of the river while simultaneously making it possible to develop it as a transport route for ships .
It falls under the proper budgetary procedure and the outcome of the vote will be final .
This resolution suggests a lot of things which encounters the negative provisions of the original text .
Mr President , you mentioned that Croatia 's accession is not only important for Croatia and the European Union , but it is also important to signal the whole region .
Thank you .
For this reason , the Italian delegation from the Dominican Party ( CDU ) decided to abstain .
On the other hand , it is necessary to postpone eurobonds to demonstrate a desire to rescue the euro .
I would like to ask you whether you are in agreement with me that , over the last few months , Opel has sown severe financial difficulties that the company could produce much more cars than produced at the moment , and that the difficult economic situation of Opel does not have to be caused by a free trade agreement that has not yet been absorbed into force .
We are prepared for this , and we have both cooperated on both institutions - the Council and the Commission ( i.e . President of the Commission ) .
We also urgently need such a signal and this money is also in the framework of the 2010 budget .
Your officials are calling for a review of the rules for rehabilitation and of hygiene arrangements , to promote preventive work , to review unemployment benefits and to reduce excessive protection for workers .
I have to say that I am shocked that some people , on the pretext of respecting the culture of migrants , are actually refusing to recognise these things about cybercrime .

In the world , we must concentrate , except on anything else , on the rules of market participation and on the costs of competitive producers outside the European Union .

( FR ) Madam President , please wondered in Rome and Paris and their followers here in the European Parliament are aware of what they are actually looking for to restore internal border controls .
That is the first thing I would like to say .
We believe it is right and recommend that Parliament give up the golden model of budgeting .
Both the Council and the Commission are now in favour of the full participation of Taiwan in UN bodies , and I hope that they will take advantage of the possibility made by Taiwan as a result of this disaster in order to promote its inclusion in these structures .

Foreign attempts to intervene are rejected and finalised at the end of the day .

Six hundred minutes plus two .
That is why we need to reduce the conversion of our labour market .
In my opinion , the proposal does not contain the necessary instruments for effectively tackling the problem of red tape .
However , I do not understand the motives for listing some of the parties on the list .
Madam President , the words are money , the words are instruments and words can be weapons in foreign policy .
This place is in the middle of this House , behind the Eurocrats , because you are the Council , the Commission , the Commission , and also Parliament .
The world has asked for answers and , nonetheless , months later , we , citizens and politicians , especially in such a platform as the Union for the Mediterranean are still materialising and do not react .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , Commissioner , when the independence of another overseas country , South Sudan , on 9 July , will be shut down another chapter from the federalist heritage of this continent .

President Medvedev 's immunity are neither proof nor a guarantee of real progress .
To conclude , I would like to thank Parliament for its participation as a colegislator on the sensitive issue of asylum .
Finally , allow me to highlight one of my introduction : the lack of ambition of the agreed regulations on e-health in the field of e-health , once again , due to the strong opposition by the most prevalent Member States in this area .
On Amendments 1 and 4 : in connection with the amendments relating to the addition of child clothing and followers , I would like to remind you that the draft proposal is limited to local acceptance , labour-intensive services .
I hope that the negotiations will not take too long .
This influx of new money on the markets is aggravating food prices and other goods .

For companies from European Union countries , there will be benefits if we manage to resolve the problem of public procurement , to the medicines market - where there is insufficient recognition of international standards , with services - including financial and phytosanitary services , as well as access to small and medium-sized enterprises .
This is accompanied by the fact that , at the same time , Nazi crimes committed by Hungarians are not investigated .
( LT ) Thank you , Mr President , Commissioner , at some stage in 2006 , we , the Lithuanians , have actually tried to introduce the euro but , unfortunately , do not meet the criteria of a draft .
Another area is to improve energy efficiency , which the Swedish Presidency wants to take root ; it means that the Troika of post-communist countries , France - the Czech Republic - Sweden will be the most sustainable energy actor and by all countries .

Next year , there will be a significantly larger number of international forces in Afghanistan .
The trust in our approach and the maturity of our approach , as well as our sustainability and communication , are the best weapon that we have in our dialogue with Russia at a time when our citizens are fuelling the development of strategic partnership with Russia , rather than the renewal of the 'old War ' .

Last September , Parliament voted to allocate EUR 600 million .
Honourable Members , we need to do as more to support countries around the world .
Our aim - in this case the double objective - is to help clarify the responsibility of the various parties in the war in Gaza , and , furthermore , we are moving closer to the future , I would say that we should ask ourselves what we can say today in order to help restart the dialogue .
These are special rhetoric that do not lie elsewhere in Europe .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , for those of us who have worked hard on the Green Paper and the report , it is extremely foolish that we have reached a discussion in plenary .
Fiat , care ' can no longer work .
I am confident that data from the stress tests will prepare us for a new round of negotiations on this issue , where we will discuss a new safety policy for the European Union in this area .

We now have the opportunity to put improvements depending on Parliament 's vote .

By ensuring a strong consumer protection , we will be able to increase consumer confidence in the internal market and more generally - in the European Union .
It is good to remind ourselves just briefly what involves this first term .
It is a criminal relationship because it makes it easier and food research , as well as in terms of the advances in medicine , because scientists who rely on the testing of animals working daily in order to find medicines and treatments that will tomorrow have new pandemics .

With regard to tax incentives , the morning we had a serious debate .
The areas of responsibility must be identified .
The directive predicts all of the problems and even a success of the issue .
I will never forget this evening .
While I believe that it is imperative that 27 Member States pool their resources , I could not vote for an increase in the EU budget by 5 % for post-2013 , when we have not fully abolished existing costs in order to avoid anti-competitive costs and duplications .
I would therefore like to ask President Barroso the following : whether the reintroduction of the democratic currency of Greece - and also Ireland - is not the only long-term solution that will save us from these problems ?

We must also add the issue of Transnistria , which can lead to some kind of instability .
In his letter , Mrs Clinton also recognises that Parliament has this right , but none of the papers go further and told us how to resolve this problem ; so we believe a single vote will motivate us to create a better agreement for the sake of the whole of Parliament .
I would like to read to you what he wrote to us today in one village :
It is not possible to limit creativity , but there can be a negative impact on people 's desire to deliver .

If the existing nuclear power plant projects in Kaliningrad and diplomas at the border with the European Union have been implemented , without complying with the highest standards of safety , they will pose a threat not only to neighbouring Baltic countries , but for the whole of Europe , which is relatively close to .

I call on it to be supported .
Mr President , thank you for this debate .
I share everything from the authors of the questions and I am really grateful for their valuable contribution .

Apart from extending this concept , so that it is to cover several areas and include the linkage of CSR in our trade policies , why one day we do not make use of this concept mandatory ?
The Belgian Presidency has contributed a great deal to launch the new economic governance process and we must now continue the intensive work that it began .
I would also like to thank the Member States , who were very constructive in this area .

This view is also shared by the European Data Protection Supervisor .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to touch on the issue of accession to the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) and , at the same time , address the issue of accession to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
The debt crisis in the euro area has demonstrated the need to create economic union and economic governance as quickly as possible .
I have not guessed who should support me .
In a globalised economic climate , it is not right for the European Parliament to plan to increase its expenditure by 2.3 % next year .
That is why this is certainly a matter for us to look seriously at a growing economy as ours is our own .
It may be a little complex , but it is , in fact , a very effective tool .
I call on the other parliamentary groups and the EU Member States , which will actually resolve the issue .
The upcoming review of the train systems and the creation of a European public agency are still issues that we need to address .
The reasons are that no real savings has been made in any budget line , and the costs are often simply reported for 2013 , that we have the reduction of the tariff costs that we are likely to happen , and that the negotiating procedure for this report was not transparent and has been designed to omit smaller groups with the most resolute views on the proposed budget increases .
I voted for the report on the basis of the expert opinions that say that , at present , both Romania and Bulgaria have shown that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner .
The adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon exacerbates Parliament 's responsibility with the administrative burden that arises from this .
It is a fact that the disregard of human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law have become frequent in Russia .
In short , and this is the only solution , we need to do everything to cover immigration flows , to discourage those who are tempted to leave their country , to promote development and to ensure the collection of families only in countries of origin .
Croatia had problems with its neighbours , including Slovenia , but Croatia acted on their resolve .
Communication of Council common positions : see Minutes
That is why we need to ensure that there are positive results from the G20 summit , which has been tested for the first time , as has just been said .
The recent financial crisis in Greece and the financial imbalance in other Member States are gathering the need for political self-esteem of European economic governance .
The time has so far been lower than that of the international standard alone .
We need greater integration of our social and economic policies and climate policies in order to preserve jobs and create decent living and working conditions .
That is why taxpayers who will have to pay for the crisis have definitely had the right to be guaranteed them at least three things : firstly , greater transparency in terms of decisions on the closure of airports and the development of the situation .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Hahn for their work .
Immigration has more than one name , because my colleagues have spoken today about immigration from Africa , which predominantly affects the countries of the Mediterranean basin , and what they said is , to some extent , visible .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Oettinger , like Fukushima , Chernobyl has shown that , despite all the rules that can impose , the spiralling risk of human error must be rethought and that , in this context , we need to define what the borders of nuclear power are because apparently even the strictest regulations can not eliminate this lethal risk as a result of human error .
That is what I believe will lead us to the wrong concept that we can not , without European farmers , and perhaps only we can import food from countries outside the EU .
At the same time , it is important to point out the dangers , combining the approaches with the much-needed nature of labour standards .
We , as Europe , advocate a transition from a knowledge-based economy and we support renewable energy sources .
Last summer , apart from fires , there have been other disasters , and some of them have been very recent , last weekend , in the south of Italy .
I also hope that we will manage to consolidate the ecological dimension and not just the social dimension of this approach .
Radioactive genocide has been appointed - Article 3 ( 1 ) - in 1987 , as a ban on a group to use his own language in its day-to-day communication or in schools , as well as the publication of books and the spread of desertification and the proliferation of publications in the language of the group .
By introducing amendments to the constitution in this way , without posing real other parties or civil society organisations , it undermines the democratic process , killing the dynamics and threatens the exclusive right of a single party .
However , the European Union is the largest importer of fishery products from other parts of the world .
That is why the Commission 's initiative really deserves support , even with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs , as it does not make sense to maintain complex reporting requirements for small businesses .
I would like to point out that the US logo in the ICC is the only most important factor which lowers the public importance and the credibility of the ICC .
The future regulation must promote and develop the industry and not limit it .
The vote on the Framework Agreement will take place at 12.00 , afterwards , there will be a holiday button and then we will proceed to the Commission 's composition - that is the job of work today .
Firstly , I would like to say how pleased I welcome the fact that the report discusses the need for more synergy between the two key pillars of European policy , namely development and security .
In the long term , we can only limit our dependence if agricultural policy affects more on regional business cycles with sustainable production , insufficient transport courses and high levels of market self-sufficiency .
This is a strategic requirement for the introduction of a real European sky .
It calls for a coordination structure which will be responsible for improving cooperation between Member States in the implementation of social regulations , as well as the creation of supervisory bodies .
I am voting against this report .
In 2008 , 116 million European citizens were at risk of poverty and social exclusion .
Tyres are becoming too expensive and people travel with buses .
The EU has spent EUR 150 million in 2008 , EUR 120 million in 2009 and EUR 100 million over the coming years .
It is time to stop this horrific cloud .
The second factor is privatisation .
While the guarantee of sustainable food supplies is one of the greatest challenges , the EU is one of the most successful projects in our times , stabilising peace , stability and prosperity in the region .
I hope that , in the future , we can invest in ensuring decent wage remuneration for people engaged in creative activity , and to ensure that piracy does not threaten their livelihood , as is currently the case on the Internet with the illegal colonisation of the FVO .
We Europeans are the ones who will benefit from the square , but the barricades will not act if emerging economies are only becoming limited in the G20 or elsewhere .
The situation is one that the people who desperately need to need ICT instruments because of the claim that they have never bought them into their lives , they have not been used to use them .
One can not deny that the technical capitalisation of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist with the fight against corruption in the judicial system and policing structures .
As for public access to information on pharmaceuticals products , it seems that the situation varies in different parts of the European Union .
Therefore , I ask you , Commissioner , perhaps to include electromobility in the future in the course of the Euronest 21 ' initiative .
I believe that the new Parliament will not slow down its replies that we expect us to obtain in February .
For its part , the commitments taken in the national plans should be reinvested among the international community , ensuring in this way greater transparency for all processes .
National authorities must also start to perform a request for mobilisation of the European Investment Bank , so that funds can be allocated to the necessary amount for the rapid and sustainable recovery of this region .
I am also puzzled that , in the midst of an economic crisis with increasing unemployment , where the consequences of globalisation are viable , the EGF has received so small applications from the Member States .
Mr Oettinger , you are in the process of drawing up the Energy Roadmap 2050 .
I would like to report that , following the statements by the representatives of the political groups , I will inform you about the technical procedures in relation to the vote on the report .
It is necessary , however , to create mechanisms for batteries and control ; in particular , I voted in favour of the report on the amendment to the European Parliament 's Rules of Procedure following the creation of a common register for the clearance and control of organisations and individuals participating in the drafting and implementation of EU policies .
In the context of drawing up policies , the Council Military Military Supervisory Board and the Commission support the Palestinian National Police Organisation ( ECDC ) , and the Commission supports the Palestinian National Police Fund ( ECDC ) .
The euro provides stability and conditions for the creation of millions of new jobs , and this should not be forgotten in these days , when everyone speaks about a crisis .
We are living in unprecedented times .
We believe that this requirement will not lead to visible security benefits and represent a barrier to trade .
We are fighting for nationalism and protectionism , which were rejected for 50 years , from the time of revitalisation of the Community .
Accession negotiations with Croatia have long cooperated .
This legal act must enter into force as soon as possible .
We will do exactly the opposite .
I urge Mrs Wallström , who is a great advocate of minorities , to remind President Barroso to keep its promise that the future commissioner for Fundamental Rights will address the rights of minorities , including minorities of indigenous peoples such as the origin of immigrants and the Roma .
If we look at the global scale of how the other large regions are to be implemented , how they enter into agreements and address their partners in a strategic perspective , we can undoubtedly see that all of them develop ever more quickly .
These materials must be judged under current strict rules on the protection of human health and the environment .
Various approaches and solutions must be monitored and discussed with Parliament immediately , and that has not happened until now .
The accession will , in fact , provide citizens with new means of action : they will now be able to raise a corner in the European Court of Human Rights if their fundamental rights are infringed by a European institution or a Member State because of action or withdrawal for their side .
This decision is wise and proper .
The livestock sector is a sector with growth that is evolving faster than many other economic areas .
Do not say that we will do it , but the method remains open for us .
Negotiations are also fundamental to restore funds for the country , which have been temporarily levied by EU development aid amounting to more than EUR 600 million .
In accordance with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure , a list of 30 Members will be drafted , which will be reorganised so as to safeguard the Ukrainian political and geographical balance .
We are aware of the increasing number of falsified medicinal products in sale , and the number of millions of falsified consumed .
Two weeks ago , the Intergovernmental Conference of New York accounted for EUR 7 billion , or at least that has been promised .
Just such bilateral agreements are needed , and I therefore welcome them .
The more we increase the exchange of information at a higher level , the opportunity is to prevent the risk of paedophiles or misguided transposition .
I , too , would like this route , as well as in the summer part-session in Strasbourg , conducted its objection to the resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of chemical terrorists .
Today , we are facing at least three Mediterranean crises - financial , climate and what I would call up the ecosystems of ecosystems , or the excessive use of natural resources .
We need data , but we are aware that media records are always sensitive and we need to be careful when we demand it and work with them .
( HU ) Madam President , here in the European Parliament , we have witnessed an unprecedented event .
How do we not be cautious that on two of the issues that have seriously tolerated Europeans - the crisis and climate change - Europe is finally on the back positions ?
In its territory , there is a quarter of the world 's population .
We can not really say that we want to interrupt one thing , but to do something else .
This policy has become unprecedented with EU foreign policy .
Free trade is a good thing !
In this regard , it is only enough to look at what kind of Ukrainian relations keep Turkey with other Member States , such as Greece and Cyprus , or with a country outside the European Union as Armenia .
Workers ' rights in cross-border healthcare ( debate )
Let us look at the European defence market .
Using innovative solutions should lead to lower costs for businesses and allow consumers to enjoy cheaper and better products .
We need to be careful when discussing access to documents and transparency , let us not confuse and arrange for documentation and procedures to be made to the extent that the whole system becomes unacceptable .
Personally , I am prepared for a compromise decision .
The necessary resources must be provided to the specialists in order to develop innovative mechanisms for filling the weather and derivatives , so that they can work in terms of the conditions necessary for the necessary conditions , because at the end of the day , they are protecting all of us .
The Commission has already begun public procurement procedures - within the framework of programmes , the JEREMIE and EURODAC - in support of the construction of public authorities for pre-commercial procurement .
Better regulation of political parties and related political foundations will also contribute to transparency .
In 2003 , in line with the responses made by this consultation , the Commission published an action plan proposing , among other things , the introduction of a common reference framework containing definitions , common principles and accompanying rules with a view to improving the quality and coherence of European contract law .
Furthermore , I believe it is appropriate that European energy ministers have decided to give precedence to safety in European nuclear power plants , emphasising the importance of better coordination at European level during the modernisation of nuclear installations .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
To conclude , I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič , who has a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement , and the newly-elected representative of the Hungarian Government , among others , for assurances that the Council will accede to the agreement in the near future , which will undoubtedly have its own ambiguities , because in this case , the Council undoubtedly plays the role of a second chamber .
The agreement is supposed to be able to generate consumer distribution ( benefits in the form of lower tariffs ) amounting to up to EUR 460 million .
We should not forget , however , that they only apply to technical preparation and preparation for a political solution .
This is a real problem in all Member States , and once again , I would like to emphasise that we are not only dealing with our regulations , but also the national provisions that affect European funds .
The key is that the mechanism has been designed so that it can be fully incorporated in the future system .
We should not allow ourselves to be stunned .
It means lower energy bills , not higher , and it improves energy security .
The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the Union has competence to carry out actions to support , consolidate or complementing the actions of the Member States .
In my own country , for example , our budgetary contributions will increase by 60 % in the next 12 months .
The separation of lobbyists is a major issue and the formulation is a major issue , and we must continue to work in this direction to use this as a cure and hopefully to hope that registration will be made obligatory in the future .
I would also like to add that I do not know who representatives of the EU in the EU is discussed .
However , in Europe , obviously , we first need to find some common approach to methodology to assess the possible risks .
Please make a distinction between Mr Oettinger , the former Knesset and Commissioner Oettinger .
In 2008 , the Commission tabled a proposal for a Council regulation on the conservation of fish stocks through technical measures , which should have replaced the previous regulation .
As has been mentioned , more than 100 000 flights were cancelled , tens of thousands of passengers , imprisoned or in short , they could not travel under their plans , delays or non-existent products and freight , including business sectors and our European carriers and airports impoverished financial losses .
I also believe that macroeconomic aid will have a positive impact on Georgia 's relations with the Member States , in addition to a decisive role that will play in the proper implementation of the reforms by the government .
I voted in favour of this report because , as the world 's largest donor of humanitarian aid , the EU must pay more attention to humanitarian aid in these areas where it is urgently needed , given the dramatic increase in the number of natural disasters and internal conflicts .
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within Parliament , which all parliamentary committees should use to create more opportunities for synergy .
I am pleased to hear what you said today that you want to meet almost a handful , because your work is to leave the Heads of State or Government and the Member States back to Europe .
The Commission received answers from all 27 Member States and a document outlining these answers will be published in the next six months .
However , the uncontrolled creation of new projects and organisations to facilitate these objectives runs counter to budgetary realities throughout the EU .
That is why we voted against the compromise today .
I think it is absolutely right to entrust the issue of the importance of being visible on the ground .
People who manage cities have a particular responsibility .
The members of the committee were of the opinion that such a ban would be unbearable .
My vote in favour of my vote on the Commission team , which will be led by José Manuel Barroso , because basically , they have shown good technical preparation , seriousness and ambition to meet the challenges facing the EU without forgetting the values underpinning its creation , namely solidarity and territorial cohesion .
And for a long time , there is a single band : Europe .
According to official statistics , the Russian economy is increasing a rate of 4 % despite the economic situation , and the tendency to retain a long time .
It is now only to conclude the climate conference in Copenhagen - the last and most important task , with the greatest long-term effect .
The Republic of Moldova is a European country under its history and geographical location .
With regard to the calendar of my actions , I would simply point out that there was a variety of attempts for my sailors , but there was never a criminal inquiry , not because the Austrian judges and public championships were extradited , but because you have understood how erroneous these statements were .
Some of these proposals , I can add , are already a fact or are on the road to it .
The Czech Presidency will monitor the problem and will take further steps on behalf of the EU if this becomes , and will continue to raise this issue during our contacts with the competent authorities in Minsk .
This can contribute to changing the trend towards a reduction in the number of insurance users during tourist travel .
I believe that , despite the emergency situation , decisions that are important for the European Union must be taken intact and with respect for the principle of solidarity and equal rights for all Member States .
( SV ) As many countries , and Sweden , which I am in favour of is very much dependent on the car industry .
This mainly concerns marketing , which , in Europe , does not have a single standard for measuring qualifications .
We want to see the list of regulations and internal legislative acts that the Member States want to maintain .
The summit must lead to concrete solutions , in particular , with regard to cooperation for the renovation of thirteen areas and joint research and development in renewable energy .
I vehemently condemn the practice of violence against women and also children , in recent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa , and I would like to call on the most appropriate measures to protect their fundamental rights and their dignity .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission would like to inform the vote .
There are many petitions in this regard .
Finally , in order to avoid distortion of competition , it is essential that the fact that a third country of a third country , EU law , enjoys a passport and can carry out its activities if we respect the same conditions as complying with EU funds .
Their role is becoming increasingly evident at every turn .
Commissioner Kroes knows that there are several other third countries that still fail to recognise the principle of reciprocity with regard to all the Member States of the European Union .
Voting time
We can not blame workers , however , small-scale farmers or entrepreneurs for this situation .
We have no money for complacency .
No freedom can be spoken everywhere or consulted .
It should be possible to reduce the existing 60 blocs and control centres by around 15 000 20 .
It also states that innovation and research are two sides of the coin .
These exemptions will benefit the outermost regions .
Allow me to say a few words also about the guidelines of the EU .
I am pleased with the compromise reached on this regulation during the negotiations between the three institutions and , obviously , I also welcome the spirit of cooperation and the desire for a compromise that has prevailed in the three institutions throughout the negotiations .
In the current difficult economic situation we can not afford to ignore the opportunities contained in this agreement on our two regions in terms of employment and growth .
Instead , Europe could use the culture of external action as a two-way street , that is , at the same time , to inspire and get a fruitful dialogue with other major regional blocs , such as Mercosur or the Bahamas of the South-East Asian countries ( ASEAN ) .
Therefore , I am still convinced that by engaging with Turkmenistan , we will be in a better position to offer our arguments for the benefit of a multi-ethnic society in that country .
The EU 's Action Plan with 12 points with 12 points relating to the Millennium Development Goals was also addressed .
It is also a sad fact that there is a shortage of donors and that this protects some terrible criminal activities .
The aim is also to increase flexibility , to reform , as you will say , on the labour market - in other words , to clearly create flexible security without security .
in writing . - ( PT ) The annual report drafted by the EU has concluded that , to 125 million citizens , citizens are affected by energy poverty .
The Commission 's plans for responding to humanitarian emergency situations was both transferred in Brussels and in the Regional Office of the European Commission for Humanitarian Aid in Latin America .
It does not address the fundamental question , namely , to ensure that Europe 's reliable defence and cooperation with NATO is concerned .
Indeed , Article 182 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantees the legal basis for future developments in this area .
( Applause )
One of these is the proposal for a single EU foreign policy .
A good example is the common agricultural policy .
We need better control of external borders , more security , we need biometric data and we need to deepen signals .
It will suffer those who need credit .
Fourthly , the Commission must have political responsibility .
In the current situation , I am in favour of promoting and extending the Erasmus programmes for young entrepreneurs ' and Erasmus workers ' .
This report calls for the strengthening of basic standards relating to employment enshrined in the ILO conventions , including freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining , the elimination of liquefied and planned labour , the abolition of discrimination in the workplace and repressing child labour .
The world 's neighbour is suffering from populism , poverty ( 80 % of India 's population lives with less than 2 per day ) and disease .
Commissioner , thank you for the information on the Commission 's activities .
This represents a strong message to Parliament that action is needed .
However , we must also sit to listen and to listen to it .
This has nothing to do with party policy ; it is simply a fact .
We must ensure that they have sufficient information about the product and so on , so that they can make clear and informed choices .
These opinions will be taken into account as far as possible , taking into account the realities and specificity of this particular negotiation process .
In short , every gesture and any action that reinforces the importance of human rights are important , and we need to talk openly about this , particularly in the case of countries where fundamental human rights are violated .
That is incomprehensible .
We expect Russian troops to be bailed out by Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Russia to respect Georgia 's right to resolve its future .
I would like to mention the case with Turkey .
( EL ) Madam President , I , too , would like to raise the issue of the oil sands ; that is the reason why a similar agreement that we already have with Canada , which we already have concluded with Canada - an international agreement on the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol - is not respected .
I firmly believe , Commissioner , that the European Parliament will be trying to help you in fulfilling this task .
The introduction of these systems must be completed .
Until now , what the European Commission has negotiated throughout the world is the opposite of equality .
Perhaps if we were to decide what to arrest for those in front of ourselves before moving towards production , we would spend far less than if we knock it onto the market , and we would have had a policy to support certain markets in crisis , such as the milk market .
At the same time , Mr Dalli , we have an obligation to inform anyone who chooses to convert their holidays in a European country for the rights they have had so far and , more importantly , to alert it to the gaps and for the improvements we want to do .
Of course , the market segmentation can be very well understood between the regionalisation of stress tests and other similar information and evaluate an assessment of what is happening in the banks ' balances .
The proposal largely draws up the validity of the European strategy on CO2 emissions of passenger vehicles , which entered into force since 2008 .
Serbia has an obvious potential to implement its path towards EU membership and should do so in the name of its own interest and for the sake of the interests of its neighbours , the region as a whole and of the European Union .
While we have studied the approach to the whole of the European Union , I agree with the approach of the entire island .
This was confirmed by the European Commission , and last week confirmed it in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , without any voice against .
For Belarus , as well as Ukraine , the most industrialised system of Russia , characterised by a flexible approach to foreign policy and a resolute approach in internal policy and with oppression and repression , is obviously more attractive and gives more handouts than the EU can offer .
In this House , we have to make it clear that printer makers have the same rights as nationals of other free European countries , and this includes the right to demonstrate freely in Minsk today , when it comes to the demonstration of Belarus .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
I would like to say that we would like to see more to the present and future than to the past .
The new organisation , which I support , will make the programme more effective and modern , both from the point of view of agricultural policy and from a social perspective .
In this context , I have the following question : how can it look positively at the fact that , in Canada , the area of space of Austria has been destroyed every year in connection with the exploitation of these oil sands and that the entire bonus of the indigenous communities of the indigenous communities ?
Officially , we do not have access to this information , but through international organisations , non-governmental organisations , contacts , political parties and so on have received information - which is rather sceptical - for the situation of political prisoners .
You should also put pressure on the imperialist nuclear lobbies from the United Kingdom , which leads us to the main subject .
The vote underlines that there is no equality between Member States and , in any political group , there is no solidarity .
There are currently new technologies that can fundamentally improve transport safety ( for example public/private systems ) or reduce the volume of CO2 ( for example , drink tyres ) , if such technologies are classified as standard of new vehicles .
It reflects the extremely heterogeneous socialist approach of governance and control of economic policy , which is not appropriate to address the problems of the 21st century .
Similar restrictions exist in terms of access to tender in third countries .
As a guardian of civil rights , I am obliged to oppose this decision .
The umbilical Front quickly increases and represent a real danger for Europe .
To conclude , I can assure you that we are following the trends in food prices and , in the future , I would like to work , in the future , here in Parliament and with the Council on this issue , so that we can come forward with concrete proposals , above all , with the reform of the common agricultural policy , but also with others , the instruments .
That is what I would ask in my own country , one of the most controversial files of the European Parliament .
The Eastern Partnership is not an attempt to exercise control over this area or expand its sphere of influence .
A multi-ethnic Europe is also a driving force for innovation , to increase Europe 's competitiveness , high-speed trains , oil transmission networks for numerous distance and high-tech infighting .
We voted in favour of this own-initiative report , which highlights gender issues , in the area of precarious employment , condemning various situations and insists on a set of measures to combat discrimination against women .
Many of them apply for asylum in European countries .
Only then will I choose to vote in favour of even those eligible laws .
In this way , the European Union 's strategic reserve to combat forest fires has proven to be reassured again .
The figures show that this is a useful instrument , with 180 000 warrants and 12 000 .
For example , it is necessary to improve the process in which the licences are issued for oil and forced facilities to third countries .
That is why I have chosen to vote against the report as a whole , but I am positive to have some parts of the proposal and I voted in favour of their support .
In some Member States , at the moment , it is possible to put a blank cheque for less than EUR 1 .
However , the last attempt is not so carefully compared to what was said yesterday in the debate by several Members .
In view of this , we want to introduce some new situations , including contracts between businesses and consumers regulated by an optional instrument , which will extend the selection of neighbouring countries and the establishment of a monitoring and review mechanism to ensure that the [ instrument is coherent with market needs and legal and economic developments .
That is why I supported this report .
The motion for a resolution is empty hot , aiming to make people forget that Parliament can only accept or reject .
There really is no reason to wait with the Commission 's procedure .
The debate is closed .
It contained successfully as part of the motion for a resolution , the need for Member States to implement measures aimed at achieving territorial cohesion .
Parliament has even set aside EUR 5 million from the EU budget for this year in order to facilitate the implementation of this clause .
If the rapporteur had to simply present the report on the initiative on Monday evening , it would have been four minutes .
No confusion must be created in the selection of vague charges and payments .
Innovation encourages the interplay between traditional and mental spheres of activity .
This does not mean that we do not respect the fundamental values of the EU , or that we do not fully respect the requirements formulated in European and international law .
Firstly , the first and principal objective of structural policy must be the promotion of real convergence , carving up the role of an instrument for redistribution in terms of costs , inequalities and the recipient caused by the internal market , the Economic and Monetary Union , and the liberalisation of world trade , for the countries and regions of the European Union , which are at least developed in economic terms .
This modern slavery is deeply susceptible to poverty and exclusion , and therefore the elimination of the unacceptable living conditions in which many Roma are created must be the main strategic objective .
I hope that this will remain the case .
At present , Japan needs real help .
It will propose the alternative source of this in the Nabucco project .
National governance declarations should help us to see how this money is used by the national authorities and who are responsible for using these funds .
In the context of south-eastern Europe , the definition of synergies is when there is the ability of one group to go even with its best individual member .
As far as the financial side is concerned , I asked for the initial proposal to be revised .
Mr President , the Stockholm Programme is part of the creation of a common legal and judicial system in the European Union .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , if everything is simple and clear , as we seem to have warned some of the speakers who have spoken this afternoon , let the European Commission as a ruling to establish whether the Hungarian text is legally compatible and in accordance with the fundamental principles of the troika of our European Union and things will be clarified .
In addition , the report argues that cutting the budget will threaten European solidarity and economic development .
( PL ) Mr President , in the second half of September this year , Russia and Belarus took military games with the iron names of the West War II and the South African Federation .
Fortunately my country , Ireland , is a member of the euro area , as the current currency is a source of stability for Ireland and for other countries at the present time of unprecedented mountain and global recession .
With regard to the notorious updates imposed by the European Bank for Development ( EIB ) , which is a risky instrument financed by the EDF to promote private investment in the context of difficult economic and political things for ACP countries , I have very mixed conviction to say that the EIB should present a report as part of the discharge procedure , but this will be discussed , especially if Parliament is hoping to the Union to become more responsive in the EIB .
Consequently , the provisions of Directive 2003/37/EC on type-approval of agricultural and forestry tractors , their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery , together with their systems , components and separate technical units , apply to this directive .
On 11 March , Japan has been affected by a serious earthquake , followed by the tsunami , which caused the greatest nuclear crisis in the history of the country , after the Fukushima nuclear plant hit serious structural damage and then is in the immediate danger of re-imposing a nuclear disaster .
I share the rapporteur 's view .
We are aware that another framework for compliance with international law is needed .
Mr President , I will quote the Franco-German missionary , and I will continue to go to Swedish , 'if the whole of humanity abolished one would have the same opinion , and only one person would be in the opposite opinion , it would not have been a lawyer to make this person worse than the hypocrisy if it would have had such power , if it would have had such power , it would have the right to rush mankind to steal ' .
Such a result will be very well managed by the dynamics in the EU .
The Innovation Union will best use public money .
We would like to hear Commissioner Reding 's speech on these issues .
I would like to send a very clear message to the Commission .
We would like to see that .
I call on the Council and the Commission to gather the Nabucco project clearly .
It seems that the Commission is completely blind for the problems in this area .
Moreover , the earthquake hit the poorest side of the Orthodox hemisphere , where 80 % of the population lives below the poverty threshold , and 54 % - in recent times .
I ask you sincerely to support this compromise .
The Council of Europe is currently working on a new draft regulation on anti-discrimination , and I would like to draw attention to three aspects .
That is something we oppose .
Finally , I hope that efforts will be made to deal with delays .
There was a link between the two sides .
Relations between the EU and Ukraine have always been close and based on a constructive dialogue .
These are the only power stations that are totally safe .
The most recent examples are the cases of people who are being lured to paint , without being blamed charges .
In what extent , and are the various Member States passing their rail lines and trains with national championships systems ?
So the banks are working .

I have taken the question of whether the way in which the national Government has liberalised the test law was right and , in accordance with the spirit of our European regulations , is right and in accordance with the spirit of our European regulations .
The document approved today highlights the clear need for additional support from the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) in areas of strategic importance for the re-establishment of the European economy : small and medium-sized enterprises , companies with the lowest dominance and other key projects to promote growth and employment as part of the Europe 2020 strategy , the report urges the EIB to invest in freight research in the European rail sector , as well as in other the Trans-European Transport Network , with a focus on the forests of the Mediterranean , the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea , with the aim of finalising them exhaustively with European markets .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , inspired by the unanimous vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control , the decision to refuse to grant discharge , which was presented to you today , is vital to our institution .
It will also contribute to preparing a green paper on the potential of cultural and creative industries , which is currently in progress and expected to be represented by the Commission at the beginning of 2010 .

That is why we need to discuss it and now .
Forests can not be kept off without audits of pesticides .
Our responsibility to protect citizens ' rights is fundamental and we always emphasise that .
It is gratifying that Parliament 's assessment is to coincide with the positive position of the LIBE Committee and the citizens of both parties ( Bulgaria and Romania ) to hear that their institutions have made the necessary sense and the slowness of the migration ' is already in green terms .
If we had adopted the final proposal by the Council , we would not be able to say that we are defending the desire of ordinary citizens of their luggage not to be criminals from cloned animals .
The Interim Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union may prove to be the most important and more far-sighted that we have made up to now .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would prefer the European Parliament to be deterred by this serious legal failure and , in spite of all my colleagues , I offer my condolences to you and my colleagues .
However , in order for it to function effectively , this body must be given broad powers , and it must also be given a mandate to monitor the banks operating at a cross-border basis - outside its national borders .

This has been negotiated .
Mr President , we have received information that the storms of Libya , female refugees , is a brutal accident in the Mediterranean .
You can not imagine that the European Parliament deals with these issues and then do not think that nuclear technology is not sufficiently safe .

Within the framework of the OSCE , Member States have coordinated their work to ensure that the commitments made by the countries neighbouring the OSCE in this area are respected and fulfilled .
It is estimated that it will be given greater attention , if not the greatest attention , to the economic crisis that we are still experiencing , but as we see it , Parliament must fight itself to fight for citizens ' interests and to persuade them that Europe is not the source of the problems , but that it can find an effective medicine for them .

If a country like Belgium wants to ensure that Europe will not be able to take decisions on behalf of Belgium in the future , then it is high time that we want the responsible policy responsible to recognise their responsibility to the citizens , not to intervene in the work of the Commission to preserve the Statute or to the social policy of Belgium .
Unfortunately , in Skopje , the word 'war ' has been used .
In view of the positive experience in Switzerland , following the introduction of a fee on heavy goods vehicles , there is no objections to the new directive .

There are at least two countries with a different opinion in this House .
I think it is very good that Commissioner Reding is preoccupied by his proposal .
Unemployment is increasing , and access to funding is a huge problem , especially for small and medium-sized enterprises .
On the other hand , the United States , who benefit from full elimination of visa requirements throughout the European Union , refuse to provide reciprocity for Romania , Bulgaria , Poland and Cyprus .

Implementation of the Goldstone recommendations on Israel/Palestine (
in writing . - ( PL ) The Czech Presidency comes at a difficult moment for the entire European Union .
There are still a lot that we need to do , and we need to make sure that democracy building is a large part of this journey , but we are involved in travel and with what we can do .
The European Union plays an active role in Arctic matters .
This is a priority , but there are many more specific proposals in the report on which the foundations have already been made by the Treaty of Lisbon and with the ratification of UNESCO conventions .
As far as the death penalty is concerned , a positive sign in this direction is the fact that the Turkish Constitutional Tribunal once again has all the death sentences issued since 2007 , and we are aware that some of them will be repealed .
This is the principle that I have spoken about when we debated and communicated in the same way in this House .

This agreement will be useful mainly for the citizens of Estonia , Latvia , Malta and Cyprus , who still need visas to enter Brazil .
Construction has a sense of urgency insofar as it contributes to society as a whole , but if someone carries out business in order to suppress others , rogue traders and companies with a business directory , only because of their own expulsion and , by extension , uses the most toxic is pure fraud , even though I suspect they do not do anything illegally .

In the context of the increased awareness of people in Europe on health issues , and very high standards of environmental protection and health in Europe , it is unacceptable that there will still be carcinogenic substances used in Europe .
It may also enable us to make additional funds available in the measures that will be adopted in Copenhagen at the end of this year .

There are still the markets in energy policy in the field of energy policy , for example , where transparency must be increased .
The European Union has arrived quickly , but not in order to make advertising , but by focusing all our attention on providing assistance to those who are in need .
They are almost equal .
Today , we in Parliament need to accept it in a radically different situation , and small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are suffering exceptional difficulties and face a number of obstacles , because they are affected by the industrial crisis and the financial crisis .
Let us , therefore , support good taxation policies , without , however , impose them .
I voted in favour of Amendment 4 .

Since it is four years from the entry into force of Regulation ( EC ) No 1905/2006 , and since the Commission has already announced that it will submit proposals relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework post-2013 , it is necessary to carry out a short analysis of the results achieved so far and the future development pot .
What is your view of the social aspect , the conditions of the working of staff staff and , in particular , the Eurocrats ?
None of this has happened during the debate in the Committee on Petitions , regrettably , once again , the temptation to answer our questions .

Let us not repeat the failures of state finances , let us not repeat the mistakes and illegality of the private sector , which led to the financial and banking crisis .

Furthermore , after the realisation of this project , the inhabitants of this region will have an alternative to air transport .
The creation of democratic institutions requires a huge effort on the part of people , and a Europe that works with the EIB in these regions for years , can give them valuable support during this transitional period in building infrastructure and strengthening local businesses .
However , in today 's world , it is necessary and necessary to develop an excellent coordination with regard to policies and security .
However , much remains to be done .
I also think that the launch of negotiations on justice and fundamental rights can provide a firm context to encourage Turkey to make progress on the path towards reforms in this area , which - I believe - is our common goal .
That is the very least that he and his family can expect or that they are entitled to rights .
We must not forget , however , that our primary aim is to limit terrorism because terrorism is still a real threat , including in Europe .
Together , we can minimise the effects of the dramatic events , such as the interruption of the gas tanker that has experienced last winter .

In the case of PVC , I believe , in particular , that it will be necessary to adopt a very careful approach to finding a compromise between flexicurity and the interests of the productive sector .
This is the hallmark of the political powers of the 'democratic ' Europe , which voted in the European Parliament for a directive composed of anything else and the imprisonment of illegal immigrants for the purposes of 18 months , to name in this report , the blatant conditions of mental conditions , and call on them not to be detained .
With regard to this financial instrument , it is possible to provide financial assistance for ACP countries ( ACP African , Caribbean and Pacific countries ) in delimitation and financial support for five programmes : food safety ; the environment and the sustainable development of natural resources , including energy sources ; migration and asylum ; investment and asylum ; investment in human resources ; the role of local authorities and non-governmental organisations in development processes .

The Member States or , in the case of Germany , federal sections must have its own debates on the protection of non-smokers .

The sustainability routes for nuclear power plants in the European Union give operators an excuse to continue to exploit their fishing and seek to eradicate the actual risk that the so-called residual risks , in particular , if plants should not be closed when the results of the stress tests are negative .
The procedure includes the introduction of the evaluation in the analysis of macroeconomic indicators , the opportunity for the Commission to draw up a study on Eurobonds by the end of the year , the integrated examination of sanctions as the last step , both in terms of macroeconomic imbalances and in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact , and the issue of introducing reversed qualified majority voting for the Council Decisions .

It should be pointed out that the aim of the European Union 's common policy in this area is to maintain high asylum standards as a means of protecting the packaging , which is a priority of the principles of the Geneva Convention and the Advisory Protocol , which lays down common criteria for identifying people who really need international protection and guaranteed a common minimum level of benefits in all Member States in relation to care for these people .
I do not believe that this is the right way to do .
The Presidency is aware of many of the problems that persist .
We must not allow this opportunity to be learned .

The unrest in Japan are the most difficult .

If we want to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy to be a dynamic and competitive economy , we will probably have to allow the immigration of workers at a higher scale from the current present , in particular , given the demographic challenge that we face .
It is vital for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the earliest opportunity to be included in the two-state list , and the Commission must fully ensure the necessary technical support of the authorities of these two countries in order to meet the necessary requirements as soon as possible .

In a globalised world , it is vital for the EU to make use of its international influence to ensure that workers ' rights are protected in a way that oppresses personal dignity .

The Black Sea has this important issue today , today .
I believe that the Commission and Parliament are now in agreement .
The report also includes a travesty that remains to be made in the EU 's discussions on culture : that there is a single European identity , a single European culture , and even that it is based on values such as freedom , democracy , tolerance and solidarity .
