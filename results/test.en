I , for example , know that it is extremely difficult to remove the Sellafield department in a given airline .
The Fund for Research and Technological Development is one of the EU 's biggest funds .
One of the possible explanations for discovering so many new cases each year is precisely the high level of progress caused by the emergence of new prevention programmes , most of which the European Union funded .

You thought that we may not have to comment on the current work in the Commission .
This situation makes it necessary to strengthen the mechanisms that the crisis can effectively overcome .
This hypocritical approach must not receive a majority in this House .

( FR ) Madam President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , cooperation between Europe and the United States is essential when solving most of the major crises in the world , and the new US administration is certainly an opportunity for this .
I think that the European Union must maintain a sensible and realistic policy towards Russia .
The crucial changes must come from the country itself .
I also hope that the Commission and the Member States will strengthen control of the minimum welfare and safety requirements in the workplace .
For this reason , we believe that it is important that these projects of legislative acts or working programmes do not comply with the same principle , as evidenced by Communist engineering plans , where there was not a self-proclaimed truth from beginning to end .
We need to work on this .
We must respond to the expectations of the peoples of the South .
Last but not least , I welcome the contribution made in the future Eighth Framework Programme , which must be more transparent , flexible and attainable .
This is a new task and a new responsibility for all Members of the European Parliament .

( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , many of you have read the trial ' process from the inhaler : this is the most dangerous one today in my country , a country with great democratic traditions , with a government elected by the Russian people , where it is being attempted to undermine democratic vote with unprecedented in historical terms by the media and the courts .
I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament has decided to opt for electronic documents , particularly with regard to declarations of performance of products sold on the market .
It is therefore essential that Europe does not forget about women who suffer the daily violations of their fundamental rights , such as the right to life and physical prosperity - women condemned to death by stoning ; women who are denied access to education ; women who are forced to flee and live as refugees so that they can exercise freedom that benefit all of us through the Charter of Fundamental Rights ; and women who are discriminated against only because of their sex .

The financial crisis and the debt crisis , to some extent , have had a beneficial impact assessment , making a stronger sense of cooperation , in particular , with regard to the common foreign and security policy .
( SV ) Mr President , although many questions remain , the control and optimisation of EU funds are improving and become more congested .
For this reason , I agree with what the rapporteur has said and I want direct intervention from the Commission and the Council with the aim of achieving clarity , transparency , predictability and safety on our territory and on this particular issue , with regard to which , ladies and gentlemen , we should never stop being complacent .
The item is closed .
I have read this , because it shows the importance of the Commission when it comes to the implementation of the European project , a Commission which , under the same article , is a collective responsibility to your Parliament .
I vehemently condemn these atrocities of extremism .
The Interim Agreement will be in force not more than twelve months , and the Commission has already announced that it intends to submit a proposal for permanent agreement once the new Treaty comes into force .
The penultimate issue has always been removed from the atmosphere of bad filters and suspicions .
For example , I would like to see a reduction of 25 % of the number of inhabitants living in poverty by the EU , as well as ensuring that those who are excluded from the labour market can gain access to high quality work and , at the same time , we aim to eliminate the practice of the working work .
Secondly , amendments which have ignored or inherited a very accurate and specific point in the report - that controversial political interventions should not be prosecuted - are the amendments that I am opposed to , and I am pleased to hear that many others are doing it .
Another assumption would be to recognise the militarisation of the European Union .

We will start this discussion in the autumn .

Mr President , the report on the prohibition of illegal logging , which was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , is balanced .
The actions taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government show that when they want , Europe - or part of Europe - can act decisively in difficult times .
The philosopher , a former flower of school aged , later , has deteriorated .
If the EU fails to adopt a budget , and that is still going to be established every month , our presidency will be difficult to fulfil its duties .
Of course , there is also something that exists in other areas , such as beef and fish : too large imports that are being held too easily by third countries and undermining our own production .
For this reason , we are fully in agreement with the text , which is adopted and which will establish a temporary period of 30 days , within the framework of which the country should pay its obligations to suppliers .

( PL ) Madam President , the new structure of public finances in the European Union is based on the prospect of stabilising reasonable financial rules and public spending , as well as the completely recognisable desire to limit the floodgates of the Member States .

On the other hand , with regard to the existence of free trade agreements negotiated by the Commission , we will provide clearer and inconsequential responses in writing through Commissioner Ashton 's staff .
The choice of underestimating them is a more ardent and more far-sighted approach , which not only contravenes the principles that govern our external action , but will also undermine the European social model .
I believe that this is perhaps a shining point of law , and we will certainly need to come back to this in the future but , on the other hand , it is a great step to significantly improve the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility .
Even only the huge increases in demand outside EU borders will determine this .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your statement .
The events in Japan need to constitute concern for all Member States , regardless of whether they have nuclear power stations or not because , if such disasters are occurring , 102 will jeopardise the whole of Europe .

We hope that the Commission will take these remarks into account .

I believe that legal guarantees have helped , because it has become clear that we do not need to worry about neutrality or abortion or other problems .

China achieves its trade surplus by renouncing the value of its national currency , by criminalising wages , so that fraudsters can not afford to afford imports in China , and exports prices are significantly lower than European , and thirdly by ignoring international patent rights so that Chinese companies can benefit from the fact that they do not carry out research and development .
I do not know how quickly or how slowly happens this will happen , and I do not know what buffer will happen in the meantime , but I know I know that the integration process must continue .
However , I would like to point out that the report does not only assess the policy assessment , but focuses mainly on the future , on development .
This includes guaranteeing the quality and safety of the authorities , but also providing protection for donors and recipients by identifying competent authorities .
More than half of the citizens of the Member States of the European Union are affected by halting gas supplies from Russia .

As my theme seem to me to be very important - proof of this is the very large number of people who asked the floor - we will give the floor to 10 people twice twice more than those in the Rules of Procedure .
Let me also say that , in terms of rapid measures - measures to halt tropical deforestation and the measures of international aviation and maritime transport , which pose the climate to make use of important measures in the poorest EU countries , in particular - that they need to yield results immediately .
I am therefore very pleased that the President of Lithuania , Mrs Jiménez , former Commissioner , and the government of Lithuania , has already said that the Ecolabel contravenes the obligations of Lithuania under its own constitution .

The European Year of Volunteering ( 2011 ) will allow the activities organised in this area to adopt a European dimension and , therefore , we hope that this will have a huge impact on civil society .
The appointment of 25 000 immigrants arriving by this party of the Mediterranean , with a golden burden sends out the wrong message : Germany has shown that they are not ; the Canaries and Spain have shown that 30 000 back per year per year by the African Bank are not an unjustified burden on the European Union .
We need to find a way to develop an appropriate and effective instrument for streamlining GDP that can be applied in practice , using clearly defined indicators and rely on high-quality data .

Economic change , political changes and changes to the vision , in our external arm , as a result of new players and globalisation .

The economic interests can not be interrupted for the sake of being forgotten arbitrarily and suffering .

The European Union 's accounts until 2004 and 60 % of the alleged cases of SSGI are from Italy .
In future , this can lead to deviation from the current system of separation of structural funds from the Cohesion Fund .
It must continue along the path to Europe , as the rest of the region moves forward .
According to the Court of Auditors , institutions do not cooperate in these areas or even fail to assess their own policy .
I think that , once this leads into force in 2013 , it will help achieve the objective of harmonising and strengthening passenger rights at EU level , no matter what transport resources choose .

I do not like to have the opportunity to give the floor to Members on issues of this magnitude , but you are also right in saying that this would require an amendment to our Rules of Procedure .
Some will wait to be faced by a tribunal of 10 years .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , 25 November 2010 at 12:00 .
In fact , changes such as the sizeable structural and regulatory reform of the financial sector must be carried out , but the current situation can only be improved through the creation of incentives , as well as through radical and comprehensive policies on modernisation and targeted investment policies .
For this reason , I would advise all colleagues to show a sense of measure and political commitment in these cases .
In order for the GSP to continue to work towards European citizens and to fulfil their needs , it must be given strong support , and this , of course , means a strong budget .
Of course , exporters of electrical and electronic equipment must become more active in the collection and recycling system , but we can not rid the citizens of any responsibility for waste that generate .
I am therefore calling for a simplification of the basic principle and I abstained from voting .
We need regulation and ordinary legislative procedure and we expect consultations with the European Council and the Member States on these issues .
The Copenhagen Conference and the EU must play a vital role in the negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global agreement to combat climate change .
We need to renew in this House what has been achieved - from the issue of micro-credit to combat violence on racial grounds - and for all these issues , there must be a comprehensive strategy .
Immigration is a problem inherent in the countries of the EU , which is why they must act together to find the appropriate solution to this problem .

I believe , therefore , that I believe that the Council , as the Council did , the decision by President Obama to close Guantánamo up to one year .
I definitely encourage the Commission not to remove the measures proposed and not to depart from pressure from the Member States , because only some can be regarded as an example in these days .
How is the European Union playing ?
Parliament 's call for greater protection for the consumer and the fight against energy poverty is now reliable in legislative texts .
The programme 's programme lays down the criteria for the content and the non-binding budget for the invitation to submit proposals that will be resumed in 2009 .
Everyone talk of economic governance , but what does it really represent ?
Parliament has the following message , which is supported by a huge majority .
Only findings and definitions of a longer period will reveal the economic situation of both sides , the bilateral improvement of trade balances or the contribution towards improving the social situation .
The PRC was encouraging - in 1995 , a global consensus was achieved in 1995 , according to which women and men are equal from all of the points of view , including political , legal and social .
The Community method achieves it .
Implementing the collection of statistical data ;
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Mr Barrot , you have my support , which you want from this House , that you have no mention of this rapporteur , and you have all been in the first order of my report .
We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that we prepare the necessary financial services regulation .
I sincerely hope that the Commission and the Member States will take action on the basis of approving proposals in it .
I abhor the Internet in the Internet how easily it is to feed fingerprints on German bail-outs , and the justification that if the identity cards reaches the form of credit cards , the rubble can be repaid , which will make a lot of disrespect to compile biometric data ; it would easily have been controversial of the chemicals .
The first of these is the exceptional mobilisation of the aid mechanism and global solidarity , which sent thousands of people to support those affected by the first phase of the emergency .
I am sorry that Commissioner De Gucht did not even listen to what I say , but instead prefers to speak with his colleague .
( FR ) Mr President , 2009 was undoubtedly a year for the euro after its introduction but , at the same time , the most ambitious .
The report examines well guidance and specific measures to protect jobs , ensuring high quality employment throughout Europe .
This efficiency will not come for one night , and therefore we can expect further reinforcement of the flow of economic migrants fleeing North Africa .
Both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are considering the issue of the Bible .

Every time , when you meet with people who are burdening tobacco , between those who are most concerned , is this - what will happen with us ?

Fine Vassiliou , Mrs Vassiliou , is not present in this debate , but she asked me to convey my personal thanks to the rapporteur for everything that he did and for the efforts it has made to achieve the objective .
Europe 's duty is not to survive , and once again , and again to repeat and remind them , and to demand that we are generous and firm , Russia fulfils its obligations .
It is true that not all Member States have consular protection and , in many cases , consular protection is very limited , and the creations structures are insufficient , even for the perpetrator themselves .
( PL ) The Europe 2020 Strategy can not do all what they are doing today .
( EL ) Thank you , Commissioner , for this very detailed reply .
If you look at , for example , the situation of railway stations , it is at the heart of this in airports .
In the last 10 years I sit in this House , and I wonder how we will reach this by adopting a regulation following regulation after regulation , unsecured business and opportunities , and in fact encouraging business to move outside the continent .
After the Second World War , when Europe has gradually decided to accept that the independence of African countries is eventually inevitable , Kenya was strongly excluded from this figure , together with the country that we now know like Zimbabwe .
Europe needs developing climate change , enabling the market to be transformed into economic recovery while , at the same time , undermining its acceptance by citizens , defending their interests ; on the part of consumers , ensuring their rights ; and by small and medium-sized enterprises , providing them with the right to incentives .
In addition , we want to increase our efforts in relation to professional soil , people in secure age and older people who are no longer in the education system and which are lagging behind the general development of society .
That is also my view .
I am fully convinced that this will create differences between Member States equally in terms of the amount of visa applications .
They take part in a very constructive atmosphere , and I think that this is indicative of the need for the European Union to achieve it , and also for the interest of Turkey to face ourselves with regard to readmission .
Council and Commission statements on preparations for the European Council meeting ( 28-29 October )
Europe must keep convincing this message .
These tobacco have already been held in several countries , particularly in Latin America , where prices have rocketed and the quality is deteriorating .
For this reason , in the face of the challenges of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , it calls on authorities to realise that reduced public investment in these areas can not be offset by private investment , which , due to weak growth , are also undervalued and therefore guaranteeing the re-establishment of public finances in the short term .
This is a particular step that the citizens of the Member States of the European Union expect from us .
The technical rules proposed on the basis of scientific consultations are simplified compared with existing legislation : they will facilitate inspections of people and reduce the costs of fishermen .
Even on the territory of a confederation in its various regions , different approaches can need different approaches .
The separation of competences between the Presidency of the Member States and the President of the European Council will be of great importance .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a very careful evaluation of the request made by the European Council to start negotiations with Japan for the conclusion of a free trade agreement .
The European Parliament considers that the adoption of the Law protection law from the Detrimental Effects of Public Information by the Lithuanian Parliament represents a flagrant violation of the treaty .
Formal sitting -
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I am generally pleased that the 5th World Water Forum will take place in Istanbul and , above all , that the European Union will be involved with its delegation by the Commission and the European Parliament .
We really need to regret that no measures have been made .
In future , particular attention must be paid to cohesion policy and structural policy , as well as agricultural policy , and it is also necessary to support small and medium-sized enterprises , because it contributes to whether Europe becomes a sustainable and competitive economy .
I support this report , which reiterates once again that we need to help Moldova to recover economically , bearing in mind that around 40 % of its economy depends on agriculture .
Unfortunately , the way in which the report was met shows that it did not result in reconciliation , but even greater objectivity .
On the other hand , a country that still depends heavily on energy production from unfair fuel is faced with technological speeds , which needs to overcome , reduce polluting emissions .
When the Treaty of Lisbon is granted to people , one of the arguments was that it will give the European Parliament greater influence .
It is clear that it is a combination of action for people 's inclusion , and also the ways that we have to take them , is what makes a strengthening of integration and all that it involves .
The truth is that the Commission has presented ambitious proposals to show the economic situation under constant monitoring and that we will also do other proposals if it proves necessary .
Therefore , this is a situation where , in Polish imprisonment , a man fired a sentence which does not conform to the principles of Polish law .
This is the position we should strengthen and help to consolidate .
Some people believe that we will create a fragmented system if we have a one-stop shop for each corridor , instead of connecting the national 'soft department , which may perhaps be included .
I am afraid that in the run-up to enlargement , Parliament and EU institutions have disregarded issues of strategic importance for the Member States .
We voted in favour of this report by the Czech Member from our political group because we believe that it relates to an element of enormous importance : improving energy efficiency through information and communication technologies ( ICT ) .
On the contrary , we need to retain the market shift in the labour market , provided that the liberalisation of workers is more adaptable and accountable to the needs of the country concerned .
Thank you for your attention .

Baroness Ashton , let us act quickly and seek the best results , because this will prove another important test for Europe .
We are witnessing the violation of human rights , which we all need to condemn , without exception , and I am therefore voting in favour of this resolution and I add my voice to those of my colleagues who urge all parties to keep calm and refrain from such acts of violence .
Access to the network : cross-border exchange of electricity (
It has also been said that , in order for others to join the EU , we in the EU must be well integrated , because then the adoption of new Member States will be effective .
The interest of social housing derives , on the one hand , of the provisions relating to State aid , but it also relates to the definition that is used when determining eligible costs under the Structural Funds .
In the meantime , the European Union does not really control and manage the funds , it is doing things under the rules .
That is why our new economic architecture is broadly relevant .
Their change could mean changes within the fisheries framework and even provoke disputes with local fishing companies , which use machines mainly to prevent quality fish in the market .
The growth of profits and modern development are the inhumane components of today 's universities , but in the face of a great deal of convenience with business and with the conversion of purchasing professions ( I am thinking , in particular , to the arts and humanitarian science ) , it is very important , with the aim of preserving the balance between economic and sub-regional success , modern universities to retain some of their deep academic links with its herds in financial terms .
We will find these things in the programme .
My committee did not take any part in the drafting of the resolution .
We have another example of the fundamental problem in the Medicines Agency , which I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss again .
The sudden tactics directed at the section of the financial market is draconian approach .
I am pleased that there is light from the first results , but it goes without saying that this is not yet enough .
A small amount of bureaucracy and legislation - which , until recently , ran the development of innovative small businesses - are being poured and young people start to disperse the implosion of a stable future , which we hope is tailored to opportunities .
I assure you that , because of my interest to my portfolio , I will keep the events very carefully .
I will begin by saying something that will happen soon - 8 March will be an important day , as it is International Women 's Day when Parliament in Strasbourg will discuss the Charter of Women .
There must be global supervision of the financial markets .
At any end , this place is increasingly similar to the Soviet Union .
They have listened , Prime Minister Orbán , to your ministers , but also the political and bitterness dinner you have put in a half-hearted job .
That is why I voted as I did .
We have had laws on numerous issues .
Once the Czechs were unable to invade peace in Afghanistan , the same ones did not have the money that we had .
We also expect recognition of the European ambitions of Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine and Russia should be urged to stop exerting political pressure on these countries .
In future , it should not be allowed to pay for the taxpayer .
It is obvious that the main emphasis on the debate on port and transmission is based on the so-called public broadcasters , under the definition of each Member State , given the minimum resources available to them , given the minimum resources available to them and , consequently , their dominant important role to work in favour of the public .
The Scottish President of Turkey , the invitation for a conference entrusted with the Bush President , who is a hint of genocide , and the country 's relations with Israel seems to indicate that it is behind the West .
The passion that we raise from the point of view of the Committee on Petitions are the nature of a horse-trading dispute , what options are created for the development of the local economy and , above all , I will come back to this later - revolving application of the law in the European Union .
Even the best ideas , if they are attractive , can not be achieved if there is insufficient financial resources .
Before we were to blame , without saying in court .
( PL ) Mr President , I endorse the European Parliament 's draft decision for granting discharge to the Council discharge for the 2010 budget .
Rape , and even loans made available to entrepreneurs from Community funds , provide an institutional lever that can and must fill the gap left from the commercial banks as a result of the financial crisis , which has already affected the real economy .
Imports of beef will rise by 70 % , oil imports , by 25 % .
Apart from the fact that some areas of medicine in countries with high medical standards can quickly be betrayed , there is also a risk that poorer Member States of the European Union , which invested less in health care , must pay huge costs .
Human rights are a key element in relations between the European Union and Eritrea .
I deeply condemn and reject this double standard , and I call on colleagues not to descend up to political sympathies , but to transmit to those responsible , the Commission and the Hungarian Government organised an assessment and conclusion of the problem .
( Applause )
What agriculture needs in the future , however , is regulation that manages to keep the volatility of the markets in certain borders .
We have three to have three of a cold , and it seems that the Netherlands will be playing at the latest .
I really hope that the Commission and the Council will continue this path .
The credibility of EU policy and the future of the European Union depends exclusively on effective democracy .
There are four reasons why I consider it very important and why I voted in favour of this report : 1 ) simplification and streamlining procedures in order to facilitate access to funding ; 2 ) the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises , which are essential for growth and employment ; 3 ) innovation in the name of a competitive port industry that is capable of responding to the challenges of the market ; and 4 ) the Risk-Sharing Financing Facility , which until now gives a very good amount of good results .
In addition , the outcome of the crisis must , of course , be reflected in the commitment to the strategy , to be credible in changing the growth model and the emphasis on the economic , social and environmental aspects .
The negative choice of the word 'united ' is very important for a good result .
However , we , the Commission , are ready and to start work and contribute to the negotiations , as soon as the ministers decided that sufficient progress has been made .
We must also recognise that there are also cultural differences that sometimes seem to be blurred .
This Eurovignette , ultimately , calls for the same kind of monetarist and neoliberal policies and criteria , tightening up the real 35 rate imposed by Member States without addressing the causes of problems or alternative policies that take into account the different degree of development of the economies of individual countries .
I have the impression that we have to say many things on the issue of Japan .
( PT ) The case of Farai Maguwu shows the brutal repression in Zimbabwe , as well as the need to extend the scope of the Kimberley Process .
In fact , we are hardly short-lived .
Coastal countries in the Middle East and Africa have advanced developing countries and they are vital in some key areas , including in this context of migratory flows .
You will repeat what President Barroso said : that we are very encouraged by the political commitment of Prime Minister Orbán to submit amendments to the law if necessary .
In addition , the safety net and promotes the decentralisation of small-scale farmers .
These are ideas that I would like to summarise , before I again come here with some proposals on the issue of insurance tankers .
At the informal meeting of the Energy Ministers on 6 and 7 September , the Presidency asked to take place , and we discussed the first assessments .
In order to create a common labour market for researchers , it is important to define and establish a common European Judicial model in science , as well as to establish an integrated system for information with proposals for employment and off-premises contracts throughout the European Union .
Therefore , the proposal to use cyanide is very valuable and clear .
They expect us to expect solutions , expect protection , and we need to meet these expectations precisely now and not in a few months .
This proposal is very important and must be controlled by regulatory authorities in the Member States .
There are other facts and policies that come at the forefront .
Mr President , once again , the laws that we are adopting here are not being implemented in all Member States .
I will also present my concerns for this .
We are proposing extremely good measures which are fully tailored to the objectives of the European Union .
I think that maintaining employment , as well as the creation of new employment prospects for the youngest people , as well as those who are in the labour market , but they no longer have jobs in order for Europeans to return their trust to our social model .
The creation of the European Asylum Support Office is an extremely important step towards establishing a common European asylum system as provided for in the European Pact on Asylum and Immigration and in the Stockholm Programme .
It claims that 2.7 million people were contaminated in 2008 .
The Heads of State has gone very well , and I believe that the result is a good one .
I insist that it is important to take account of the experience gained during the years when the old SIS II has developed , and the fact that economic governance has become more democratic with the inclusion of the European Parliament throughout the surveillance process .
We are not thinking about what to say , but the system is simply too ineffective .
In my region , Miguel , this is considered to be the most economical competition , which will have serious consequences for employment .
Malta needs the aid of the country in order to return to the labour market and find real economic independence from their grandparents .
In fact , one of the greatest difficulties is the complexity and severity of administrative procedures , as a result of which the European funding for researchers are channelled into national funding and Europe becomes more detailed in the field of research .
This will also be the subject of discussion from the public authorities that are interested in the work of this agency .
These actions presuppose the democratic process of content and forced a quarter of the country 's population to feudal .
( PL ) Madam President , for many years nuclear power is considered to be energy in many years - ecological , effective environmentally friendly .
In Malaysia , more than 10 000 people are suffering this form of corporal punishment every year .
I voted in favour of this report because it promotes the development of so-called intelligent transport systems ; in other words , the use of new transport technologies .
I am obliged to say that there is something ashamed in the fact that this report has been detained until the success of the referendum in Ireland and abhor all voices , and then suddenly left the proposal for all the representations of the European Union in the world to give responsibility to Parliament and become part of a single European diplomatic body .
It can only bring more suffering and crises .
I have taken note of your proposals .
In this regard , I would like to highlight two issues that I consider vital given the current situation of the economic crisis and the increasing high levels of unemployment in the EU , with a view to protecting quality , dignified employment and the creation of new job opportunities under the Europe 2020 strategy .
We need to prepare for this time in a responsible way .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to thank you for this interesting debate .
This gives us hope for the future .
The EU 2020 strategy can be different .
Explanations of vote
We agree that the innovation , creativity and the aspiration to be better placed in the market necessarily , but we do not accept that only because someone is greater and stronger to better connections with regard to information and , in particular , special links with the government , these kinds of benefits must be applied onto the market , and we are very pleased that the Commission is in office to ensure that this does not happen .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , I would like to say that we consider the issue of extremely serious ; action is needed , and it is not time for complacency .

I think that , at present , I could describe the situation by taking advantage of the Magnitsky suspects of FIFA , and now the ball is in half of the Council .
Implementing measures ( Rule 88 ) : see Minutes
These ambitious tasks are : to give more reflection to the opinion of European citizens , to achieve a more democratic European Union , thereby giving impetus to European integration .
One of the things that I think will be very interesting when the Commission starts to consider the future of the GSP regulation is to see whether the aspects of the regulation , which relate to the ratification and implementation of human rights conventions , could be improved .
That is why we are finalising an amendment which tries to draw up a budget , greater to reality , which I hope will also be supported by the other groups when we vote later today .
It is noted that Russia is not willing to introduce effective measures to avoid the many cases where the Russian authorities have broken human rights and have been condemned by the Court of Justice of the European Communities .

Fifteen years after the adoption of a provision , it is difficult to understand how much little measures can be made for its implementation .
Only the pay-as-you-go market ( ECAs for renovation and maintenance and supply of spare parts ) would be the subject of a specific visa regime .
As you probably know , there have been some serious issues , particularly in the area of energy and trade .

I hope that this Parliament will play a key role in ensuring that the CAP is in any way enforced or reduced .

Tyres are more than diminishing , representing a source of income , and through their jobs within the family and society , both young and older people are making a significant contribution to the inalienable ineffectiveness of our society and for the stabilisation of services and jobs .
It is also the reason why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wishes to reinvent the referral document in committee , not because we believe that we can not improve the situation , but because it means maintaining reform which will , in the future , accumulate our legislative life .
( DE ) Mr President , I believe that we have produced a good piece of legislation today .
We are counting on all those who fought for fundamental rights and freedom of the press , and I am giving it my generation to my generation , which knows something different .

Mr President , if you - or colleagues - do not believe that the Mercosur issues , which I and other fellow Members have asked , are unacceptable because they are not appropriate issues , I believe that they were not accepted because there is such a point on the agenda for Thursday .
What happened is that we have heard once again the demands of more cooperation and greater coordination at European level and the single European sky - something that has already been mentioned - will prove fruit for the future .

The Croatian authorities have clearly applied the prevailing laws and procedures .
The first conclusion for me is that we are also continuing to have a strong European common agricultural policy .
That is why the issues of supervision in this area must be resolved .
The enlargement process of the European Union is proceeding exceptionally in geographical terms , and as I have already stated in this House , the Council is quick to confer candidate status before the countries concerned have attained the quality of democracy , which at least move to a fundamental satisfactory level .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur that the agencies need to improve the transparency of the forecasts and responsibility for projects ; to improve the procedure for awarding public procurement authorisations at the level of funding and work programme ; to remedy the mistakes of recruitment and to increase objectivity and transparency in this context , and to apply and respect the Financial Regulation to which they are exposed .
( HU ) Mr President , the report before us is perhaps the most important report in this period .
What we are going through at the moment , Mr President , is not , in my opinion , an industrial crisis in the Union , not even a crisis of our common currency ; but rather a crisis of governance of the EU .

Soon , Sweden will have the opportunity to implement them in practice during its chairmanship in the second half of this year .
A few years ago , Lithuania was in the same situation , but we did not reach a patchwork of the most persecuted tree in a ruthless indicator .
We do not have to do so .
Much has been achieved by the last Energy Efficiency Action Plan , but there is no justification whatsoever that the objective can be achieved by 2020 .

I am proud , in particular , that in the new European executive authority , Italy , in the face of Mr Tajani , will provide continuity of merit and competences , as it has been designated one of the key uprisings , namely industry , which is of strategic importance in the management of the crisis and in the conversion of European production .

Albania will cope .
Are we not expecting the democratisation of Russia ?
That is precisely the question : if we do not put anything on the golden basis , we are putting together all the European law and all our institutions .
I believe that it would be fair to keep these sacrifices too .
We expect to make progress on this issue .
However , at a time when the economic and financial crisis exacerbates social inequalities , the provision of the Structural Funds of the Member States is decreasing .
Thank you .
We will very much look for respect for the fundamental principles of our proposal .
The Member States must integrate the priorities for acquiring basic skills ( reading , Swedes , VII ) in its educational programmes , before pupils take place .
What we need is another economic and social model to resist capitalism .

During my closing term , Mr Barroso , who drove some Member States of the EU to support the war in Iraq , headed by George Bush , has never dared to unite the European Union or to strengthen its positions to national personal interests .
Following the recent earthquake in Italy , does the Commission think that it is covered in her Seoul response from the year and provided by Mr Barroso Mr Dimas , or intends to take further initiatives to protect European citizens from earthquakes ?

I did not vote in favour of the report on agriculture and international trade as it depends on the geographical element of EU trade policy : free trade agreements .
Yes , Europe is the world 's leading donor of humanitarian aid - we can be proud of this and we need to continue in the same spirit - but the humanitarian aid is not going to solve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians .

Application of information technology for customs purposes (
We have been working hard for this , let us not go back !
The amended draft mission , which the European Union hopes to have an influence in Kosovo , smacks more than a tool to plug this domestic divide than anything else .

The fact that most errors are noted by the Court of Auditors and the Commission in the projects and payments operated by the Member States shows very clearly where more efforts need to be made , and immediately , because shared governance represents around 80 % of European funds .
The resolution adopted today takes account of the fact that fisheries management must be based on up-to-date and accurate scientific knowledge of stocks .
We have already spoken in favour of accelerating negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and the Gulf countries .
For this reason , Parliament , the Commission and the Council have agreed to pursue this objective .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) is seen as an effective foreign policy instrument promoting the strengthening of relations with third countries , which has certain real benefits .
In my opinion , a much more transparent solution to this issue is to be found , which clearly states that , in the next revision of the Interim Partnership Agreement , the derogation of the rules of origin will be eliminated forever .
In relation to renewable energy consumption , I would like to thank Parliament , who supported the recovery plan and express its confidence in the future use of wind energy from housing in the sea .
This clearly applies to the proposal to introduce automatic exchange of tax information , both within the European Union and at international level .
This is a key aspect of the flexibility that I asked me to do , either by the secret EPA , to replace a trade regime exclusively on ACP ACP , with a case that brings regional solutions to regional needs without penalising ACP solidarity .
Parliament and the Council have included this principle in the regulations implementing the authorities and , in particular , in Articles 42 , 46 , 49 and 52 , who Minister have referred to just a few minutes ago .
Bosnia and Herzegovina ( vote )
It is clear that the law refers to the fundamental rules and values of the European Union , which is a community based on the rule of law .
That is why our group is calling on the rules not to be so strict .
Something else , which is extremely important to me , was to use more resources to increase the energy efficiency of our buildings .
The Commission is very concerned about the high degree of fertility and illicit trade in the recreational disturbances that we have seen lately lately lately lately .
However , in the current situation of the car industry , given that cars are not sold , in fact , in the debate with the Council that , in fact , 12 months is probably an early period and we had to take into account the serious consequences for the environment of tyres , which are still in an excellent condition .
For this reason , it is also in progress and Turkey 's status .
( FR ) Mr President , Taiwan is being threatened since the terrible natural disaster without precedent in the country for 50 years .
There should be no violations , because that would be unfair to others , often older and poorer producers .
These people need to pay unjust samples for lawyers and other experts to defend themselves in court without whom they know what they are successful .

( DE ) Madam President , as a staunch supporter of the European idea , I was opposed to the Treaty of Lisbon precisely because it opens the line for the arguments we have heard a moment ago , and precisely because it does not create for future generations the clarity and the dilemmas that I very much want .

I believe that this is the main issue of the new annex : the society to be credible and feel safe .

The anti-grassroots policy of the Member States ' transport ministers includes a demand for sustainable and oriented towards the future transport policy for the European Union every Sunday , while , at the same time , it is being done by all the way forward to prevent such a policy to prevent such a policy .
Are you in favour of cooperating to deal with breaches of competition rules in relation to third countries ?
I believe that the European system of responsibility for the lack of compliance must be taxed so that consumer protection and market confidence can improve , thereby increasing the daily cycle of products .
I am sure that the Commission will say more about this in a few minutes .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the two institutions , the two institutions need an official ban on 30 years ' agreement .
At present , waste electrical and electronic equipment represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the European Union .

Patients which , in other Member States , will have trained access to health services that do not exist in their home countries because of certain natural conditions , too , will benefit from this .
The Stockholm Action Plan must reflect these needs in terms of mobility , labour rights , the needs of businesses and equal opportunities , inter alia , while promoting legal certainty and access to fast and effective justice .
( NL ) Mr President , in the wake of this Parliament , there is a silver envoy for tar sands in Canada .
My third question is : What are the consequences ?
The conclusion is therefore : State aid must be maintained because it supports the competitiveness of European maritime transport and the economy of the Member States .
This is not the job of the European Parliament .
We also believe that it is important for the integration of accession talks with Croatia .

The European Parliament is for clear European regulations .
We have talked about some of these issues today .
We believe that the only solution to the problems of corruption and organised crime is the consistent application of new laws and regulations .
I know from the talks that I have made that , of course , is possible - if you want - to create a more favourable sample of these elements .
There is now a legal basis for transforming accession into reality .
Since the allocation of renewable energy production is indeed one of the main objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy , I assume that in the forthcoming period , we will certainly have a higher budget in this area , including the budgetary chapter for regional policy .
A legal agreement on global climate policy would be precise worded and extended in areas such as : quantitative targets for reducing emissions in industrialised countries for 2020 and then , specific emission targets in developing countries for 2020 and , subsequently , financial assistance for developing countries from industrialised countries , development and technology transfer and codes of treatment .

Our constituents are entitled to know that we are very seriously aware of everything and we do not accept the decisions made by the Council .

The problems with the Stability and Growth Pact are not due to the lack of conformity or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit by the Treaty of Maastricht set out in the Treaty of Maastricht for a new debt of 3 % .
Furthermore , I am opposed to any increase in the staff of Parliament and , if possible , following further evaluation , that EUR 1 500 per month should be allocated to the secretariat of the secretariat , it would be a pacifist with taxpayers .

That is why it is necessary , independently of rational evidence , that standards are equal and if they are so , then there is no excuse whatsoever not to transpose this principle throughout the European Union and hopefully , soon , and throughout the world to achieve the ideal - free movement of professionals .
It is also a fact that , if we want to make an easy way to reduce CO2 , we need to turn our attention not to shipbuilding or leather industries , but rather to the energy sector .
In this context , it is necessary to proceed to a thorough evaluation of the recovery and reconstruction package and the effectiveness of State aid measures .
Mr President , in my voting list , it appears that paragraph 36 was demonised , and I therefore wonder whether we had to vote at all .
The economic and social crisis in the country has grown to unprecedented levels , which is due to the road of members of the European Union and of admission at national level to the measures advocated : more intensive policies , increasing the exploitation of workers , new antisocial measures that exacerbate inequalities , increasing unemployment and job insecurity , as well as increasing poverty and social exclusion .

It is also important not to ignore the positive impact of the improved management of bio-waste , namely the impact on the functioning of the internal market , on the future of agriculture by preserving and restoring soil fertility and promoting renewable energy .

( EL ) Mr President , it seems that , in the proposals that the United States Secretary of America has responded to Israel during his visit , it has also been extended to stop the building and expansion of Kaliningrad in the West Bank , to open the floodgates and end the seizure of the wall and creditors of East Jerusalem , and in connection with Gaza - to allow for the necessary rigour and building materials for the recovery of reconstruction .
I hope this time will take advantage of the lessons we can learn from this process , and indeed to work hard for jobs , both at European and national level .
Work on achieving this point was long and prejudicial , and Parliament knows this very well .
This is a structural problem , widespread in all areas , countries and continents .
This assumes the need to draw up more efforts to reduce disasters and to provide support - apart from one-off aid - to support the capacity of communities in connection with disaster applications .

In my opinion , the European Union really achieves its objectives and now decides solutions with both its citizens .
However , I think that is wrong .
There is no need for a reference to air security .

In order to achieve this , we need to focus our attention on the Member States so that - as Spain has done , in addition to transposing the Council framework decision on this - to be able to develop and implement action plans with interest groups , including programmes for raising awareness of the population and for social mobilisation , without neglecting work on international cooperation .
Overall , the ratification process of a European contract Treaty is quite often as a departure or a miracle victory .

It is true that , today , I wondered instead of another rapporteur , but I will permit myself to say a few words to highlight something that is already contained in the report by the Committee on Budgets , namely that it is important , of course , that we always think about savings and whether the costs that are taking place are justified and documented .
So let us not start by indulging that only because of Brussels , there are privatisation .
Another achievement of this legislative period is that Parliament 's role by the European Councils is no longer confined to the one-minute speech of the President .
New proposals make it possible for Member States to determine who is and who do not fall under the scope of the directive on persons engaged in road transport activities .
As I said , this is an important step , but not the last one .
That is why I believe that the recommendation made up today to the Commission to review the impact of the air traffic in the near future and to review in this context Directive is the most appropriate method that we can offer in these uncertain times .
( HU ) Mr President , I am not speaking as a Member of this House or as a pat to the northern unrest , I would just like to warn everyone that the North-West carrier does not represent only economic or energy heritage , but it is also one of the main examples of our natural heritage .

My aim today is to assure you that the Commission has committed itself to the work , taking into account all the policies that can have an impact on the reform of the common fisheries policy .

The points we face are a consolidation or monopoly in supply and transit , lack of privileged single market , and particularly the vulnerability of the Union 's eastern border .
What is more , the European Union is based on inalienable values , which include combating all forms of discrimination , and I will work for this value throughout its term of office .
Secondly , there is an initiative which goes further than this simply to use GDP in the implementation of the Structural Funds , and also includes the hierarchy of the profession as a deterrent measure - when there is a disadvantage .

There has been a very great deal of discussion and I do not know whether the idea will have success - whether Parliament will vote in favour of our proposal .
On the one hand , this is a threat to the health of EU citizens , because the conditions of food production are not clear and , on the other hand , the attitude of European agriculture is poor , because EU production for production and correction are not applied on agricultural products that have been attacked by Mercosur countries .
The road to create the conditions required for peaceful coexistence is leading through the European Union and maintaining the visa-free regime , giving its personal contribution to achieving this objective .
I am strongly opposed to the creation of new agencies .
These are obvious facts and they demand , they promote the implementation of a global strategy .
That year , there is a new position in the budget this year , the Baltic Sea Strategy ' , and I hope that both the Commission and Parliament will initiate appropriate projects and find the appropriate means for the appropriate measures .

This is good news for the credibility of the meat market in the EU and , in all areas , a good job is made .
There is the excessive use of chemicals in agriculture , which harms our food and the environment , and farmers are forced to pay a high price for these industrial products .
2009 discharge : 17 , ninth and Tenth European Development Funds ( EDF ) (
I strongly believe that with their hard work and cooperation of the Czech Presidency , we are in a position to reach an agreement at first reading , which is very important .
We need stronger Europe and genuine cooperation with the United States in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
in writing . - I welcome this resolution , which calls for the possibility of coordinating at European level the international conventions of international adoption strategies so as to improve support in the areas of information services , to prepare international adoptions , the processing of international adoptions , the processing of applications for international adoption and services following adoption , given that all international conventions on the protection of the rights of the child recognise the protection of orphans or abandoned children .

We also expect a future agreement on a package of proposals to create a new financial supervisory structure in the European Union .
Food security as a target can not be achieved without dealing with two of the most important issues of the day : market volatility and prices ( which are heavily influenced by speculation on the commodity markets ) and the reduction of food stocks .
The pressure made by the European Commission is the subject of this debate on discharge , while the part that has emerged from the European Investment Bank is currently collected from the discharge , and I would like to come back to this later .
Firstly , it must also be asked at Community level to monitor national authorities strictly enforcing stringent regulations .
These services must include health and provision of care , education , free time , transport and broadband .
I am sure that most of you will share the opinion of the rapporteur and confirm the many important improvements made in this agreement .
Allow me to express my displeasure , and with regard to the fact that in paragraph 31 of the report , the report stresses that a directive that regulates corporate social responsibility should not be adopted .
In my opinion , this is quite legitimate why we do not allow the European Union to sign the convention .
All measures must be implemented in full compliance with international maritime law .
The bulk of the budget is affected by different kinds of error .
We are in mind all of this and we will take it into account .
Finally , I would like to say that the Innovation Union can be a truly good tool for solving climate problems .
I take the opportunity to come back to the first part of this issue and raise the subject of public procurement in general and the subject of limited procedures for which many people claim that they are or lead to money .

The document identifies a single application procedure for third-country nationals wishing to be admitted to the territory of a Member State to work there and offer them a secure legal status .

Childcare facilities are not only helping women in the development of their careers , but , in particular , they can develop the skills of children as members of the public .

However , the hundreds of thousands of thousands of the good intentions are still .
We know that , within the next few months , the Commission intends to come up with a revised recast proposal with a view to the criticism of the Council .

The debate is closed .
In this sense , ACTA will have no impact on European citizens , because it will not create new obligations for the European Union and the need to implement legislation .
I believe that , in a debate like this , when we discuss such a topic , when we discuss such a topic , we should rather focus on future measures in order to ensure that such situations are to be avoided and , if I may say , it is even more important to ask ourselves the question of whether or not we are not going to have similar figures devoted to public attention in any way to reduce citizens ' trust in the work of the EU institutions .

We are pleased that these areas are covered in the report on the High North of the European Parliament , together with valuable proposals on how to act in the future .

I will try to answer .

Therefore , there is a contradiction here - it is not possible to have an increase of EUR 300 million and , at the same time , there is no increase .
I have done this five years ago , and we are talking about a more far-sighted process , where we should also see the people that the Member States have submitted to nominate the Commission .
They are stranded because they do not have opportunities for professional development , senior wages or means for scientific activity , and research centres do not incur new inventions , because they do not only have money , but also the organisation to accept new groups and develop new ideas .

Around 8 of 10 children in the European Union use the Internet , and I believe that we need to make special care to protect the most vulnerable children against ill-treatment , grooming for sexual abuse and harassment .
I must also make it clear that these criteria were determined by the Member States and for them not requiring approval to the Commission .
Social Kármán , which continues to dominate the issue , and the continued spread of the disease , with high mortality and particularly adverse consequences for the least developed countries , as well as those in the most vulnerable situation , must mobilise the state of concern and to the involvement of the EU institutions and Member States to ensure the available resources for implementing a comprehensive and effective response , capable of ensuring the necessary harmonisation of prevention policies and adequate treatment of the disease .

I would call on the Heads of State or Government of the European Council in June to discuss this issue .
I will comment on some of these areas .
Given that animal welfare is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency , and given that countries such as Ireland have already successfully implemented animal welfare schemes , including the renovation orders mounted by the dealer , ensuring that our beef animals are more powerful and better equipped to practise travel , whether the Swedish Presidency is planning to take account of similar heating schemes so as to ensure a balance between the sustainable export of live animals , with the aim of ensuring a balance between the sustainable export of live animals and the preservation of animal welfare in any new legislation ?

I am pleased that the Commission is aware of the important role played by business .
This topic raises a large number of political , legal issues and security issues , which need further study and consultation , and which is also very important - will require the commitment of the Justice Ministers and home affairs ministers of the Member States .
However , before we criticise our own house .
The information that is confusing for the general public does not necessarily mean that we should no longer worry about climate change but means that more research is needed .

This political support is vitally important , all the more so because there is a risk , and I strongly emphasise that Moldova is considered a local problem , which is a step towards becoming a problem for Afghans within the European Union .
There are significant differences between these countries where the general principles of the Financial Stability Board are allowed , there remains too much freedom for manoeuvre in implementing them ; in fact , at European level , it was necessary to ensure that Member States transpose the text of the directive consistently .
I believe that we need to complete this process temporarily .
The first will be able to use from 2014 and provide caution better than a gold , while the accuracy of GPS is several metres .

All of us , too , and the Member States , we have a lot of work to do in this area .
We have just had a contradiction .
We are talking about genuine equality of opportunities because it should be equally easy to build the Christian Church in Alexandria or Ankara , as it is to build the pioneers in Brussels .
In these circumstances , the renovation of the summit in Nagoya could not be at a better time .
I believe that this extensive debate has taken on the forefront of the fact that we are faced with a huge problem that brings us up with a huge challenge .
A target of poverty , will send a strong signal that the EU is being forced to provide opportunities for everyone in society , even at the most vulnerable and most vulnerable people .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , and I hope that we will have the power to find the answer to this question : what is the Internet , can it be regulated and if to do so ?
Commissioner , I look forward to hearing your proposals on corporate governance issued in the Green Paper as this is another package of documents on which we will certainly continue to work in the coming months and years .
I believe that the agreement will pave the way for new economic benefits , whether for consumers or airlines , and will strengthen cooperation between countries on both sides of the Atlantic , thereby benefiting the European Union .
We can not forget that rising oil prices directly affect fishermen ' incomes .
We started work , because now it is time for implementation of action and of 14 action guidelines laid down in our communication on the Internet of Things , I am pleased to announce that for some of them already works .
We need to construct safe nuclear power plants and , at the same time , using the Structural Funds , to support agricultural communities to promote strategic emphasis on the link between energy , water and biotechnology , thus strengthening diversification of energy bases .
Now let us continue .
I would like to stress the request to the Commission to conclude agreements containing clauses on democracy , human rights and respect for social , health and environmental standards , while ensuring effective monitoring of compliance with and implementing these standards in practice .
I seem to me as the beginning of a successful partnership .
( DE ) Mr President , in 2000 , in 1989 , there have been 1 200 people in the world .
However , I would like to ask Parliament a few questions and try to give some answers to this , why the Commission has proposed a directive confirming the identification of ITS and , secondly , whether initiatives at local and national level are insufficient .
It is important that we find a more assertive way to get out of the situation whereby the Union should show its disapproval through specific measures such as sanctions or visa restrictions , but at the same time we must not isolate Belarus from the rest of Europe , because the entire multicultural society will suffer and not only the bodies posted from the EU .
It is necessary to combat terrorism , but it must not be used as a nightmare for eliminating the rights and guarantees of citizens .
The European Commission 's policies need a new direction .
I think that Article 3 of the joint motion for a resolution , which expresses the will to increase aid for fishermen , is of crucial importance .
There is a need to increase public funding and to develop more instruments and programmes to promote energy efficiency .
This kind of measure would help ensure Greece 's development plan .
Mr President , within the course of the discussion that is taking place at the moment , I would like to ask a question about the impact of the crisis on the implementation of the directive in the countries of the European Union .
More and more countries are turning to nuclear energy for civil life and , unfortunately , for military purposes .
The Turkish Government continues to treat as many terrorist forces protesting against the violation of the rights of Kurds .
So far , we have received , and we have responded to approximately 400 opinions , as well as since the Commission acted in office , we have improved the number of direct contacts with more than 500 meetings between Commissioners and bodies of the national parliaments .
It should be stressed that these Voluntary Partnership Agreements in the timber trading trade must not go against the EU 's stated objective of combating climate change , resulting in a cessation of the deforestation and degradation of forests , and related carbon capture and associated carbon dioxide emissions and the loss of biodiversity globally .
That is the famous shame !
However , the euro is not in isolation .
We do not need regulation , Mr Stoiber , from those like you .
We should not be surprised , because the problems start .
In my opinion , however , this is not enough .
The new protocol was signed on 13 May 2011 and the same date the Council has submitted Parliament 's request for approval .
Commissioner Kallas seemed to a great deal less enough , but I would like to remind the Commission that transport accounts for 25 % of CO2 emissions and therefore requires urgent action .
You have taken the cause of a loss of man .

The Commission communication raises different rounds of issues as part of the debate on possible reform of the common fisheries policy by 2012 .

I know , Commissioner , that the Commission is already interfering and doing this through numerous projects and means .
Although industrial and consumer associations support the Directive on energy labelling on energy labelling , it can not be argued that it is fraught with technological achievements and innovation in the energy market , because , firstly , we need to emerge from this situation in the whole of Europe so as to set up a new dimension to consumers ' lives .
Furthermore , we are pleased that the value will be obligatory from the first pillar , and direct payments will be distributed between the various Member States and the various agricultural sectors .
The transfer of data without an agreement has been well made for many years .
I am pleased that , in this regard , I can emphasise the progress made by Romania in this area in recent years , as the Fundamental Rights Agency states .
We believe that there is a great risk that the disastrous effects that we hope should have a tax on financial transactions on the financial market , not being achieved if the EU is using this tax .
We need once again to address this issue again and again .
It is definitely necessary that it should be a strict budget of restrictions .
Since these practices are burned and accused tours tours , and this leads to the implosion of the public .
Around 100 of these requirements were successfully met .

in writing . - ( DE ) Thank you to the rapporteur .
Anyone who rejected them - and I would like to say this very clearly - and anyone who accepts the text of this resolution , have voted in the face of being allowed to allow hearings to carry out its disaster policy in the camp that is controlled .
The content of the report is the direct consequence of the negative 'green ' ideology that we need to attract land and the planet at first point , and that we can not look for people , their needs and interests .
The new multiannual directive creates new challenges , pressure to modernise national health systems of the 27 Member States of the European Union , and certainly the need for convergence and cooperation between all medical systems in the EU-27 of the European Union , with the aim of exchanging the best practices , promoting e-health , and making permanent improvements to the standard of cross-border healthcare .
We know that the financial crisis has made the financial groups that survived , in greater and more democratic terms .

This cooperation will allow for conflicting viruses to be avoided and to increase the credibility of the forecasts used in the planning process .

The Commission firmly believes that deepening the economic ties between the EU and neighbouring partners should always be accompanied by a commitment to compliance with the principles of good governance .

in writing . - It is imperative that the CAP be appropriately adjusted to address the challenges in the future .
The adoption of this directive is an important result but , at the same time , its transposition in national law is , in fact , the key phase in the process of ensuring the proper application of the legislation by the Member States and that no obstacles will be made and barriers to the Single Market .
It is open to open trade , so it was not easy to reach agreement .
This example is not contradicted as it is from the United States , which is , of course , a ally of the EU in many areas - in fact , the case is perhaps more important since , in the fight against the death penalty , there is no place for double standards .
In the context of the Sixth Doha Conference , the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) negotiations can also examine issues relating to Islam .

While respect for the principle of reversibility must be given to trustworthy and technical solutions for final disposal , so as to ensure potential access and waste use of waste for technical reasons , or if progress in research has led to the continual emergence of new technological solutions , such as beatings .
I regret , however , that the mandatory indication of the minimum disposal of all products , including those with a minimum injection of more than 30 months ( Article 15 ) , was not adopted .
In this regard , we still have some difficult debates in terms of how this will be fully achieved in the various sectors - industry , the energy sector , transport and housing - and in the Member States .
That is why decisions during the Spanish Presidency are very important , because it will identify political solutions , as well as the effectiveness of the European Union .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you , in general , but in general , I hope that the Commission considers the moment is the right to review the guidelines for the vertical restrictions that you have just mentioned , because in fact , they have been more than ten years .
Indeed , Parliament must play an important role in the way in which research is carried out .

in writing . - I support this report , which requires responsibility and clear rules for subcontracting in Europe .
Others have provided certain elements of information , mainly on costs relating to the provision of legal assistance and translation .
Perhaps that is a good thing .
Look at the wealth of the banks , the biggest reason is quoted as the main reason in this sense , because these are , above all , technical scrutiny : I would like to say that the technical modernisation of banks is in the interests of the banking sector and of the banks themselves , because in so doing , they modernise the banking market , their payment systems and increase their profits .
The eruption of Judge Afiuni is a sad reminder of the widespread attitude of Venezuela to human rights .

Mr President , I think that the European Union has become too large , and contains too many cultures ; it is simply failing to trust the system as a whole , and it is also difficult for things .

Finally - and thank you , Mr President - we believe that the chapter on sustainable development must include binding commitments in terms of respect for social and environmental standards and , in particular , the social standards of the ILO .
It will probably be in the interests of the Commission to include the European Parliament in legislative initiatives at an early stage in order to ensure an effective process that is in the interests and benefit of the people of Europe , as well as for active democracy .
Because a person can be discriminated against on the basis of each of these subjects and if nothing is done with regard to one of them , it becomes useless and all made in relation to the others .
We have had many criteria and , if possible , we want to cover all areas of relations between the EU and Russia .
( PT ) We need to learn lessons from the extraction of oil in the Gulf of Mexico and the subsequent environmental disaster .
The Member States must be able to adapt to the circumstances .
It is based on a common system of reception for asylum seekers , as well as the examination of applications and solutions affecting the future of these citizens .
Laurent Gbagbo must recognise defeat .
Thirdly , there is indeed no potential assessment of the financial impact , there is no study to determine the size of costs , and I fear that I have to express a disagreement with you , Commissioner : I do not think that the study conducted by the European Parliament on sharing the burden , considering the costs associated with these proposals .
For example , in connection with the decisions adopted on non-traditional electrolysis equipment or in the case of steel for a great deal of absorption , covering reductions in the equivalent of 25 to 75 % .
That is why we are calling for a 'soft ' role , as well as Parliament , to be regularly informed of any initiatives in this area .
However , this can not be the case with intangible and gradual changes .
Together with the Kaliningrad countries , we need to extend and coordinate our efforts through a common regional strategy , just as you mentioned .
In my opinion , the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the Mediterranean are not a pretext for celebration , since the last proposal by the Turkish Cypriots is contrary to the existing consensus on certain issues , which means that it is actually a step backwards .
Small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) must be supported above all .
Finally , this response to the crisis must be justified for citizens , it must be recalled the environmental and energy priorities and confirm the position of the European Union , and yet we have only opened all avenues , all avenues of opportunity , so that we can achieve exactly what we want .
However , we have voted in favour of the resolution as a whole .
Similar investments are subject to compensation thanks to savings during the Tokyo stages of the appeal , as well as a reduction in the total amount of costs relating to asylum seekers .
Therefore , the framework agreement with Libya can only enjoy Parliament if certain conditions have been met .
I can only deplore the fact that the European right has adopted tighter accelerated procedures on the basis of the understanding that all asylum seekers are predominantly superior agents , thereby restricting their rights .
What is going on in Xinjiang ?
For this , it will help support and promote small and medium-sized enterprises , because they employ the largest percentage of EU citizens .
It would not be appropriate to start the process for the Commission to organise some form of militarisation in EU territory to reconcile the soil and to find out what has been raging about which citizens would send a initiative with its fellow citizens .
However , as a whole , it is a good result , which is completely in gaol with the objectives of Parliament , of the Council and the Commission , namely to combat trafficking in human beings , this dreadful modern form of slavery , this terrible crime that Europe has in 2010 does not deserve , and which is a serious violation of the fundamental rights of so many citizens .
I really believe that the same will happen later this year , but I do not want to give a situation where we receive a document not for 2008 , but for 2007 .
The problems in the euro area today are clearly proof of the failure of the anti-nuclear approach , which has functioned over the last 10 years with the so-called open method of coordination .
The temporary study of the British detentions of municipalities proves exactly this statement : a system that provides an immediate response to asylum seekers is very low and delayed and degrading killings of the patient families is also much more traumatic .
It will ensure that any person who claims to be the victim of a breach of the Convention by the institution or structure of the Union can submit a complaint against the Union before the Strasbourg Court , under the same conditions as complaints against Member States .
In future , we need to make the food aid scheme durable .
The main investment that will allow this objective to be achieved is the Nabucco pipeline .
The second aspect relates to the marketing of pharmaceutical products .
What kind of structural changes can the European Union offer the world ?
A few months ago , I supported the need for an urgent revision of the provisions on drug-related crimes in the so-called 'migration laws ' .
